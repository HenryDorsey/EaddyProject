A crisis came in Tylenol's sales when the analgesic was contaminated in-store with cyanide causing 7 deaths. To allay public reaction to this disaster, staff volunteers manned a telephone hotline, 150,000 press advertisments were taken out, and 450,000 mailgrams sent. The food and Drugs Administration testified that Johnson was not responsible for the contaminations. A decision was made not to change the name of Tylenol for its relaunch. A tamper resistant pack was designed and the product relaunched on November 11th. Within 12 month's Tylenol's share of the over-the-counter analgesic market has risen from 7% to 28.6%. \""
