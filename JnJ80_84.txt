A crisis came in Tylenol's sales when the analgesic was contaminated in-store with cyanide causing 7 deaths. To
allay public reaction to this disaster, staff volunteers manned a telephone hotline, 150,000 press advertisments
were taken out, and 450,000 mailgrams sent. The food and Drugs Administration testified that Johnson was not
responsible for the contaminations.
A decision was made not to change the name of Tylenol for its relaunch. A tamper resistant pack was designed
and the product relaunched on November 11th. Within 12 month's Tylenol's share of the over-the-counter
analgesic market has risen from 7% to 28.6%.

Shortly after the cyanide scare, Tylenol's share of the over the counter analgesic market fell from 35.3% to under
7%. Mr Robert Andrews, assistant director public relations at Johnson and Johnson, described the comeback as
"an amazing public relations exercise". This was done by withdrawing and destroying 31 million bottles of the
capsules at a cost of $100m. All advertising was stopped and tamper resistant packaging was introduced. Two
months after the crisis, the product was back on store shelves. TV advertising resumed, in January, this year.

J.& J. Reports Profit Increase NEW BRUSNWICK, N.J.,
Oct. 27 (AP) - Johnson &
Johnson today reported thirdquarter earnings of $150.3 million, or 79 cents a share. In the
same period last year, earnings before an extraordinary
charge were $146.5 million, or
78 cents a share; net income
after the charge was $96.5 million, or 51 cents a share.
The extraordinary charge of
$50 million last year was related to the company's withrawal of its Tylenol pain reliever from the market after
tampering with the product led
to the poisoning deaths of seven
people in the Chicago area. In the first quarter of 1983,
the maker of health care products temporarily withdrew another product, Zomax zomepirac sodium. Lawrence G.
Foster, vice president for corporate communications, said the
Zomax withdrawal continued
to depress sales and earnings.

JOHNSON AND JOHNSON, the major US pharmaceutical group, yesterday reported flat third-quarter earnings
and sales reflecting, in part, the continuing impact of its decision earlier this year to withdraw its Zomax
prescription pain-killer from the market.
The company withdrew Zomax from the market in March following reports that five people had died after taking
the drug, which had worldwide sales of Dollars 82m. Withdrawal of Zomax, which reduced first-quarter earnings
by Dollars 20m or 11 cents a share, 'continues to have and adverse impact on 1983 sales and earnings,' Johnson
and Johnson said.
It was the second major blow to hit the company. A year ago the company was forced temporarily to withdraw
Tylenol capsule products from the market following the tragic death of seven Chicago area residents who took
the drug after it had been tampered with and laced with cyanide.
Although the company has reintroduced Tylenol in new tamper-resistant packages and has regained much of its
earlier 37 per cent market share, the third-quarter results yesterday provided a further reminder of the incident.
Net earnings were Dollars 150.3m or 79 cents a share compared with Dollars 96.5m or 51 cents a share a year
earlier, when the Tylenol recall cost Dollars 50m.
Worldwide sales for the latest quarter also remainted flat at Dollars 1.47bn.
The impact of the drug withdrawals is even more apparent in the nine month figures when net earnings were
Dollars 424m or Dollars 2.23 a share, down from Dollars 394m or Dollars 2.10 a share.

CHICAGO, Oct. 26 -- James Lewis, accused of trying to extort money from the makers of Tylenol after last year's
murders, intended only to focus the attention of the authorities on his wife's former employer, his attorney
contended in wrapping up the defense.
Mr. Lewis is charged with attempting to extort $1 million from Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of the
concern that manufactures Tylenol, in a letter that demanded the money ''to stop the killing.''
The letter was received by Johnson & Johnson after seven people in the Chicago area died from ingesting
cyanide- laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules. No charges have been filed in the deaths.
The defense attorney, Michael Monico, said that ''intent is the issue in this case'' and the author intended to
expose wrongdoing by LeAnn Lewis's former employer, Lakeside Travel Agency, of Chicago.

Extortion Defense James Lewis wrote a letter to Johnson & Johnson demanding $1 million in the Tylenol murder
case last year, but he didn't really want the money, his attorney said last week. Mr. Lewis, who is on trial for
extortion in Chicago but has not been implicated in the murders, contended he wrote the letter only to get even
with his wife's former employer, a travel agent who paid workers off with bad checks before going out of business.
His letter instructed the Tylenol manufacturer to deposit the money in a certain bank account, which, it
developed, belonged to the travel agency.

When Procter & Gamble was accused of promoting Satanism, the company turned to its consumer center, which
took more than 100,000 calls on the company's 800 number, to make its case. ''It also helped us track how the
rumor was going day by day and hour by hour,'' a company spokesman said. P.& G. later successfully sued
several individuals for spreading the false rumor that the company's moon and stars trademark was a sign of
loyalty to Satan.
Johnson & Johnson found a similar use for its consumer hot line during last year's panic associated with the
deaths of seven Chicago-area consumers from cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules. The company
continues to operate a half-dozen consumer lines. ''It is a way of humanizing the large corporation,'' said Jane
Yates, a vice president for Johnson & Johnson Products Inc., the unit that makes Band-Aids and dental floss.
Soft-Drink Rivalry
Yesterday, Edward W. Frantel, president of Seven-Up, a unit of Philip Morris, announced that the nation's
third-largest soft-drink company was also establishing a consumer phone center. But, almost before Seven-Up
got its first call, the Coca-Cola Company, the industry's largest soft-drink maker, announced its toll-free, 800
consumer line, also effective immediately. Coke's number: 800-GET- COKE. Seven-Up's is 800-325-7272.
Seven-Up had hoped to get a jump on its major competitor by becoming the first in the industry to establish a
consumer center. But, recognizing the public relations value of such consumer centers, Coca-Cola rushed its own
version into service.
The competition underscored the outward eagerness with which consumer companies try to show that they care
about those who buy their products. ''If you're a consumer company, you have to answer to the consumer,'' said
Mr. Frantel, who was in New York yesterday to open Seven- Up's consumer center. ''I can't image anyone saying
that's bad.''
Like a growing number of consumer companies, Seven-Up and Coca-Cola are convinced that centers equipped
with toll-free lines provide a marketing advantage. Not only do the lines provide information for market research,
but according to Clairol Inc., which expects to take 500,000 calls this year, companies also are able to get ''instant
feedback.''
Consumer Questions
Mr. Frantel said, ''It's easy to make the assumption that everyone understands what you are doing.'' However, he
added, the rapid changes in the $35 billion soft-drink industry have raised a number of consumer questions.
Among those are the industry's use of caffeine; the trend toward sodium- free drinks; the use of a new sugar
substitute called Nutrasweet, and the use of that substitute in combination with saccharin. Both saccharin, an
artificial sweetener that has been found in tests to cause cancer in laboratory animals, and Nutrasweet, which
includes an ingredient that may not be safe for every consumer, require health warnings.
Seven-Up's center will start with about 10 consultants working from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. five days a week. It is a small
operation compared with the 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week operation at General Electric, which gets about 6,000
calls a day.
Page 13 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

''One-third of the calls are pre-purchase, which of course excites our marketing people,'' said Powell Taylor,
manager of G.E.'s Answer Center in Louisville, Ky.
''Mondays are the most difficult days,'' Mr. Taylor said, adding that generally about 700 calls come in between 11
A.M. and 3 P.M. Each of the 100 consultants are supported by a data base that provides answers to 500,000
questions. By monitoring the number of times a question is answered, the company can judge whether any of its
120 product lines is presenting problems.
In some cases, G.E. technicians provide guidance on maintainence or repairs over the telephone.
Such assistance has made consumer centers popular competitive services for the appliance companies. In 1981,
the Whirlpool Corporation found that 70 percent of its calls were from consumers who wanted information on
repairs.

James W. Lewis, accused of attempting to exort $1 million from the maker of Extra-Strength Tylenol after seven
Chicago-area residents were killed last year by Tylenol capsules tainted with cyanide, never intended to profit
from the tragedy, his attorney argued here today in U.S. District court.
In opening arguments after two days of jury selection in Lewis' trial, defense attorney Michael D. Monico
conceded that Lewis "wrote the letter" to Johnson & Johnson, parent company of McNeil Consumer Products Co.,
which makes Tylenol.
The deaths last September and October caused a nationwide scare and led to a recall of the best-selling
pain-relief medicine and all other Tylenol, subsequently made available in tamper-proof packaging.
The handwritten letter, read today to the 14 jurors and alternates, said that "if you want to stop the killing,"
payment must be made to the bank account of a defunct travel agency owned by Frederick Miller McCahey, a
wealthy Chicagoan described in court as a member of the Miller brewing family.
U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb set a 3-foot-high enlargement of the letter on an easel before the jury. After a few
minutes, Monico silently removed the exhibit.
Monico said Lewis wrote the note because he harbored a grudge against McCahey. Lewis' wife, LeAnn, had
worked at McCahey's travel agency and, after the agency went out of business, her final paycheck bounced,
Monico said.
When LeAnn Lewis lost a pay appeal in a state hearing, McCahey "became a bigger and bigger enemy" in the
couple's mind, Monico said. He said Lewis wanted to attract law-enforcement attention to his wife's former
employer.
Despite a massive investigation that still keeps federal and local law officers busy, no one has been charged with
the murders. Lewis, the only person facing any charges in connection with the Tylenol deaths, is not charged with
the killings.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Giacchetti told the jury that "extortion means to twist the victim. The hand of the
extortionist is the hand of the author of this letter . . . , the defendant."
Lewis, 36, a gaunt man with thinning, dark-blond hair, sat impassively throughout the session. Jailed here under
high bond since his arrest in New York last December, he also has been convicted of unrelated mail fraud
charges in Kansas.
George Frazza, legal counsel for Johnson & Johnson, said the company had been ready to pay the $1 million but
did not do so on advice from the FBI. He said that the company had lost $100 million because of the poisonings
and its 35 percent share of the market dropped to about 9 percent after the poisonings.
He said there were about 250 reports of "copycat" incidents in the United States after the deaths. The poisonings
prompted the drug industry to redesign medicine packaging to preclude tampering.

CHICAGO, Oct. 19 -- The attorney for James Lewis acknowledged today that his client had written a letter
demanding $1 million to ''stop the killing'' of Chicago area residents by cyanide-laced Tylenol, but he denied that
Mr. Lewis intended to carry out an extortion threat.
The lawyer, Michael Monico, told a Federal jury in his opening statement that Mr. Lewis had intended to expose a
different crime. Mr. Monico said that this was the financial wrongdoing of the former employer of Mr. Lewis's wife.
He said the employer had written checks that were no good.
Mr. Lewis, 37 years old, is on trial for attempted extortion stemming from a letter received last fall by Johnson &
Johnson, makers of Tylenol, demanding a $1 million payment at the time of a wave of random killings with
cyanide-laced Tylenol that left seven people dead.
No one has been charged in the Tylenol murders.

people who died last fall after swallowing Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules tainted with cyanide. Investigators
have said they have no motive and no suspects in the killings.
Mr. Lewis is said to have sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of the maker of the popular
pain reliever, demanding $1 million to ''stop the killings.''
After the letter to Johnson & Johnson and the subsequent publicity, Mr. Lewis wrote letters to The Chicago
Tribune disclaiming any part in the poisonings. Prosecutors said Mr. Lewis was also suspected of mailing a death
threat to President Reagan.
Mr. Lewis, held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in $5 million bond, was arrested in New York last
December at a public library where he was copying the names and addresses of newspapers.
He pleaded not guilty to Federal extortion charges Dec. 29. He was sentenced in July to 10 years in prison for
mail fraud.

LEWISBURG, Pa., Oct. 2 -- A coroner's report ruled out a Co-Tylenol cold tablet as the cause of a 34-year-old
man's death, and the police rescinded their request today that pharmacies statewide remove the product from
their shelves.
''The coroner did rule out the Co- Tylenol,'' said Roger Rivera, an East Buffalo Township police officer.
''It was not the Co-Tylenol that killed him.''
The police had feared that Randall Hummel, 34 years old, had died from a poisoned tablet. His death occurred
one year after seven people died in the Chicago area from ingesting Tylenol capsules that were poisoned with
cyanide.
Elsie Behmer, a spokesman for the McNeil Consumer Products Company of Fort Washington, Pa., the subsidiary
of the Johnson & Johnson Company that makes Tylenol products, said: ''It's virtually impossible to tamper with
tablets.''

Boots pain-relieving drug given approval in US

Boots pain-relieving drug given approval in US

BOOTS, the pharmaceutical and retailing group, has received interim approval to market its best-selling
pain-reliever ibuprofen directly to US consumers.
The US Food and Drug Administration's arthritis committee unanimously recommended that Boot's
well-established prescription pain-reliever should be sold, without a doctor's prescription in low-dosage levels.
This causes Boots and market analysts to expect final approval by the end of this year.
Boots will be breaking into the Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 876m) US pain-reliever market with a totally new product,
one which is protected by a US patent until May 1985.
The FDA committee said that ibuprofen, if fully-approved by the FDA, would become the first pain-reliever in more
than 25 years to be made available directly to the consumer, joining aspirin and acetominophin, the bases of
Johnson and Johnson's Tylenol pain-killer.
American Home Products, the largest over-the-counter medicines company in the US, will market the lower-dose
ibuprofen for Boots under a licensing agreement. Both Upjohn and Boots sell ibuprofen to the US ethical drug
market.
American Home said it intends to spend Dollars 50m in the first year to promote the product to consumers. Some
Wall Street analysts predict that the product could well capture Dollars 250m in sales in a few years.

Boots says it would not be unhappy with 10 per cent of the US market in its
first year.

It claims ibuprofen is superior to aspirin and paracetamol.

Backed by its experience of selling the product world-wide for 14 years,
Boots says ibuprofen will not cause gastric upsets as aspirin does in some
cases.

It also has anti-inflammatory properties which paracetamol does not.

Further, ibuprofen's toxicity level is unusually low for a product of its
kind.
Mr Terry Steel of Boots said yesterday: 'When you can say it's new, new, new and when it's backed by a lot of
promotion, you can be sure that Americans will take to it.'
The British Government last month approved non-prescription sales of ibuprofen. Last week Boots launched
Nurofen, consisting entirely of ibuprofen. The patent for ibuprofen in the UK however, has expired, and
competitors have stepped in with rival products made from ibuprofen.

Boots intend to make the pills for the US market in Nottingham and to send them to the US for packaging. James
Capel, London stockbrokers, estimate that royalties from US sales could add Pounds 10m to Boots's pre-tax
profits in 1984-85 if the product is launched early next year.
Other analysts are less confident. Ian White, pharmaceuticals analyst at W. Greenwell, London stockbrokers,
says the product's new status represents 'one of the most significant launches for Boots in years but not
necessarily in profit terms.'
He and others cite the fiercely-competitive pain-killer market in both the UK and the US as a major hurdle for
Boots. Over-the-counter medicines often produce lower profit magins than prescription medicines. Boot's share
price closed at 173p yesterday, up 9p.

Bristol-Myers is going to dump 43 million cents-off coupons into the homes of America on behalf of Extra Strength
Datril which, if cashed, would cost it $64.5 million.
The drop will be accomplished via a full-page ad in John Blair Marketing's Sunday newspaper insert on Aug. 21.
The coupon will be for $1.50 and, since the retail price on some of Datril's 24 or 30 tablet or capsule bottles are
about that price, coupon users will be getting freebies.
According to A. C. Nielsen, which keeps track of such things, the redemption rate of coupons carried in Sunday
inserts is 4.6 percent. That would bring down Datril's cost to about $3 million. But the high face value is certain to
pull up the redemption rate.
The great giveaway is part of Bristol-Myers's attempt to get a decent size piece of the non-aspirin pain reliever
pie, most of which belongs to Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol.
The ad was created by Kenyon & Eckhardt and placed by Bristol- Myers's in-house operation.

ANNUAL REPORTS: MORE CANDOR

30 April 1983
The New York Times

Late City Final Edition

When it comes to delivering bad news, annual reports are usually a tribute to the art of understatement. For
years, muted colors, small type and oblique references to hard times have been relied on to play down corporate
misfortune.
But Johnson & Johnson's 1982 annual report breaks the rule. In the upper right-hand corner of the report's beige
cover, a square cutout reveals a color photograph of the company's new Tylenol bottle, complete with a
tamper-resistant seal. Its caption reads: ''An Eventful Year.''
Observers of such things, such as Mark Appleman, publisher of The Corporate Shareholder newsletter, give
Johnson & Johnson high marks for dealing with the Tylenol poisonings so candidly. ''A number of companies
have followed suit this year,'' he said, ''finally realizing that, if they are upfront about their troubles, they will at
least get credit for forthrightness.''
Mr. Appleman theorizes that, because 1982 was a poor year for so many companies, particularly in their sales
results, many are willing to be open about their performance and look ahead to brighter days. But more than a
few neglected to mention some of the year's unpleasant happenings. Emphasis on Candor
For Johnson & Johnson, however, the cover of its annual report was simply a continuation of the company's
emphasis on candor throughout the Tylenol crisis. ''We knew that when people opened up the envelope, they
would be thinking about Tylenol,'' said F. Robert Kniffin, the company's director of public relations and one of the
designers of the report.
The idea, he said, was to lead readers to the next page, where the new Tylenol bottle was shown as part of a
mosaic of photographs about the company's activities. ''On that page, we told everyone that Tylenol was a
profound tragedy but only one event in a year of significant accomplishments,'' Mr. Kniffin said.
Warner Communications also had an eventful year, but only some of the events are recounted in its glossy,
100-page annual report. In a letter to stockholders, Steven J. Ross, Warner's chairman and chief executive
officer, described in some detail the problems with the company's Atari unit, problems that sent Warner's stock
price plummeting in the fourth quarter. Mr. Ross even braced shareholders for the year ahead, warning that,
because of increased competition in the video game industry and an oversupply of game cartridges for Atari
machines made by the company, ''earnings in 1983 will be below those of 1982.''
Nonetheless, Warner did not mention the conviction last year of one of its top officers in a stock-fraud case arising
from Warner's dealings with the now-defunct Westchester Premier Theater. Another officer pleaded guilty in
1981. Nor was there mention made of the possible role of Mr. Ross, who was not indicted but became the absent
star of the trial when witnesses said he was involved. Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission are still investigating.
For shareholders to get the details of this and several stockholder suits, or to learn that the S.E.C. was
investigating potential insider trading by Warner officers, they would have had to study the 10-K filing the
company submitted to the agency. Asked why those details were not in the annual report, a Warner spokesman
responded, ''We did not think it was relevant to the operations of the company.''
Similar reticence was exercised by the Procter & Gamble Company. It lost two suits last year brought in
connection with the company's ill-fated Rely tampons, which were linked to toxic shock syndrome in 1981 and
withdrawn from the market.

In one case, currently under appeal, a plantiff was awarded $300,000. In another, no damages were awarded but
the plaintiff and the company reached an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum before either side's
appeals were heard.
This year's report devotes two sentences to those events, noting that the lawsuits came to trial but not mentioning
the findings of negligence against the company. Shareholders are referred to a separate pamphlet mailed to them
last June. ''We don't want to dwell on the past, but look to the future,'' said Linda Ulrey, public relations manager
for the company.
In contrast, readers of A.H. Robins's annual report learn a fair amount about the thousands of pending suits
related to the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine contraceptive device Robins pulled off the market in 1974.
The report states that expenses related to the company's defense came to more than $7 million last year. In total,
the company and its insurer have paid out $130 million to settle 5,100 claims. ''We feel an obligation to keep the
stockholders abreast of the situation from year to year,'' said Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., manager of public information
and one of the writers of the report.
The Manville Corporation, which filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy
Act last year, faced one of the greatest challenges in framing its annual report. Its report is printed in a very
modest black and white, with no pictures or graphs.
Nonetheless, Manville wanted to make the point that it had entered bankruptcy proceedings as a legal technique
to work out a plan for handling thousands of lawsuits from victims and relatives of those who contracted
asbestosis, a disease linked to the asbestos products the company manufactures. The cover of the report notes
that 1982 was a year ''of significant challenges and accomplishments,'' one of which it says was the bankruptcy
filing ''to deal equitably with creditors and claimants.''
''The following discussion of capital resources and liquidity,'' the company continues later in the report, ''presents
a somewhat unusual position of availability of funds compared to that normally associated with many bankruptcy
filings.''
Mr. Appleman sees that as artful wording. ''Manville had to spend a lot of time, I bet, figuring out how to tell
shareholders, 'We are not really bankrupt, but we have to appear to be,' '' he said.
Nothing induces candor, however, like a good year. Consider the report of Marshall & Illsley, a bank holding
company based in Milwaukee. The chairman, J.A. Puelicher, reduced his reflections to three sentences:
''Your company had a very good year in 1982. Some of it was due to luck; some of it was due to good planning
and management. We hope you enjoy the numbers and the pictures.''

NEW YORK--IT'S BEEN A TOUGH EIGHT YEARS FOR STERLING DRUG INC. AND ITS BAYER ASPIRIN.
IN 1975, JOHNSON & JOHNSON OPENED THE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN THAT EVENTUALLY
CONVERTED MILLIONS OF ASPIRIN USERS TO TYLENOL. THE CAMPAIGN TOUTED TYLENOL'S SOLE
INGREDIENT, ACETAMINOPHEN, AS THE SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO ASPIRIN.
BUT STERLING MARKETERS REPEATEDLY DECIDED AGAINST INTRODUCING THEIR TOP-SELLING
OVERSEAS BRAND OF ACETAMINOPHEN TO COUNTER THE TYLENOL INCURSIONS. THEY STRUGGLED
TO PROTECT BAYER BY BOLSTERING ASPIRIN'S IMAGE.
THIS WEEK THE STRATEGY SHIFTS. THE PANADOL DISCOVERY, STERLING'S U.S. INTRODUCTION OF
THE ACETAMINOPHEN BRAND IT HAS SOLD OVERSEAS FOR 25 YEARS, IS PART OF AN UNUSUAL $100
MILLION CAMPAIGN THAT SEEKS TO REVERSE YEARS OF OVERCAUTIOUS MARKETING.
TYLENOL HAS WON BACK MOST OF THE 35% SHARE IT HELD IN THE ANALGESICS MARKET BEFORE
THE OCTOBER 1982 DEATHS OF SEVEN PERSONS WHO TOOK CYANIDE-LACED CAPSULES OF THE
BRAND.
THE PANADOL PITCH AIMS AT THE HEART OF THE TYLENOL MARKET, WOMEN AGED 18 TO 40,
FREQUENT USERS WHO SEEK BOTH STRENGTH AND GENTLENESS, DOCTORS WHO RECOMMEND
TYLENOL, AND HISPANICS.
WITH WORLDWIDE SALES SURPASSING $100 MILLION ANNUALLY, PANADOL ENTERS THE $1.3 BILLION
U.S. MARKET WITH A FLOURISH AND FANFARE THAT ARE UNCHARACTERISTIC OF THE STAID
STERLING. THE PUSH STARTS THIS WEEK WITH $15 MILLION FOR 20 WEEKS OF TV ADS THAT ARE
EXPECTED TO REACH 98% OF THE VIEWERS SOME 49 TIMES.
ADS DON'T MENTION TYLENOL OR THE BUZZ-PHRASE, ASPIRIN-FREE, BECAUSE CONSUMER
SURVEYS SHOW THAT SIMPLY STATING THAT IT WON'T UPSET THE STOMACH IS ENOUGH.
WHILE BRISTOL-MYERS CO.'S DATRIL AND AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP.'S ANACIN-3 STEPPED
UP AGGRESSIVE ADVERTISING IN THE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE OCTOBER POISONINGS, STERLING
STUCK TO ITS SCHEDULE FOR INTRODUCING PANADOL IN APRIL. THAT PUTS IT AT A DISADVANTAGE.
ANACIN-3, FROM A MARKET SHARE OF 1% OR LESS BEFORE THE POISONING, NOW CONTROLS
ABOUT 5% OF THE MARKET.

JOHNSON and Johnson, the leading US pharmaceutical group, said yesterday that its decision to withdraw its
Zomax prescription pain killer from the market reduced net earnings by Dollars 20m in the first quarter. The
company added that loss of sales of the drug will continue to depress 1983 earnings.
The impact of the Zomax withdrawal, the second serious blow to the company in the last six months, had been
forecast by the company which last year was forced to recall its big-selling Tylenol capsules from the US market
when seven residents in the Chicago area died after taking capsules laced with cyanide.
Johnson and Johnson withdrew Zomax last month after reports that five people had died after taking the drug.
The US Food and Drug Administration is currently completing an evaluation of the drug, which had worldwide
sales last year of about Dollars 82m.
The withdrawal of Zomax from the market accounted for almost all the drop in the company's first-quarter
earnings.

THE LIST OF MARKETERS WITH "800" PHONE LINES FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS IS GROWING. THE
TOLL-FREE SERVICES HAVE SPREAD RAPIDLY IN THE PAST YEAR.
"MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GE, HAVE BECOME SOMEWHAT FACELESS," SAYS POWELL TAYLOR,
MANAGER OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.'S ANSWER CENTER, WHICH EXPECTS 1.5 MILLION CALLS THIS
YEAR. "WE'RE TRYING TO PUT A FACE ON THE COMPANY."
ANSWERING A COMPLAINT OR INQUIRY COSTS ROUGHLY $3 FOR A THREE-MINUTE PHONE
CONVERSATION. OFTEN THAT'S MORE THAN THE COST OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF AND SEVERAL
TIMES THE PROFIT THE MANUFACTURERS MAKES FROM THE SALE. THE PAYOFF COMES IN HAPPIER
CUSTOMERS.
"COMPANIES NO LONGER ARE LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS AS JUST A NUISANCE," SAYS JOHN
GOODMAN, PRESIDENT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESEARCH PROGRAMS INC., A
CUSTOMER-SERVICE CONSULTANT. GOODMAN'S STUDIES SHOW THAT ONLY ABOUT 4% OF
DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS COMPLAIN TO A MANUFACTURER. INSTEAD THEY USUALLY STOP BUYING
THE PRODUCT AND ALSO BAD-MOUTH IT TO NINE OR 10 OTHER PEOPLE.
IN CONTRAST, COMPLAINTS THAT ARE RESOLVED QUICKLY LEAD TO REPEAT PURCHASES IN 95% OF
THE CASES INVOLVING INEXPENSIVE ITEMS AND 82% OF THOSE INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT COST
AT LEAST $100. GENERAL ELECTRIC SAYS ITS TYPICAL SATISFIED CALLER PASSES THE WORK TO
FIVE OTHER PEOPLE WITHIN 10 DAYS.
THE TOLL-FREE LINES ALSO HELP PRODUCERS STAY CLOSER TO CONSUMERS. PROCTOR & GAMBLE
LEARNED OF FAULTY BOTTLE CAPS THROUGH TELEPHONE COMPLAINTS, AND POLAROID HAS
PICKED UP SEVERAL IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS CAMERAS AND FILM. JOHNSON & JOHNSON
FOUND ITS 800 NUMBER USEFUL WHEN NEWS OF TOXIC-SHOCK SYNDROME HIT. LAST YEAR J&J
ANSWERED MORE THAN 425,000 CALLS ABOUT TYLENOL POISONINGS.
HOT LINES ALSO REDUCE WARRANTY COSTS AS ROUTINE PROBLEMS ARE HANDLED BY PHONE. BUT
ANSWERING A TELEPHONE CALL ALSO COSTS ONE-HALF TO ONE-THIRD AS MUCH AS RESPONDING
TO A LETTER. COMPANIES THAT HAVE STARTED HOT LINES SAY THEIR VOLUME OF MAIL DOESN'T
DROP, THOUGH. THE NET RESULT IS A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CONTACTS COMPANIES
HAVE WITH CONSUMERS. IN 1977, BEFORE IT STARTED PRINTING 800 NUMBERS ON ALL ITS
PACKAGES, P&G HEARD FROM ABOUT 160,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. LAST YEAR THE COMPANY RECEIVED
300,000 LETTERS AND THE SAME NUMBER OF CALLS.
CUSTOMER-SERVICE SPECIALISTS SAY CONSUMERS MAY COME TO EXPECT TOLL-FREE COMPLAINT
LINES; MARKETERS THAT DON'T OFFER THEM MAY BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. ALREADY
ONE ADULT IN 11 HAS USED A TOLL-FREE NUMBER TO REGISTER A COMPLAINT, SAYS R. H. BRUSKIN
ASSOCIATES, A MARKET-SURVEY COMPANY.
NOT ALL 800 LINES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AMERICAN MOTORS SCRAPPED ITS IN 1977 AFTER FIVE
YEARS. KELLOGG STOPPED TESTING A TOLL-FREE NUMBER ON SUGAR FROSTED FLAKES AFTER
RECEIVING HUNDREDS OF CALLS FROM CHILDREN ASKING FOR TONY THE TIGER.
HOT LINE ALSO CAN BACKFIRE IF POORLY PLANNED. CALLERS BECOME IRRITATED WITH BUSY
SIGNALS, LONG WAITS ON HOLD OR OPERATORS WHO CAN'T ANSWER ROUTINE QUESTIONS. TO
AVOID SUCH PROBLEMS, MANY COMPANIES ARE TESTING LINES CAREFULLY AND PHASING THEM IN

Commercials last night on network TV marked the beginning of Datril's second attempt to take away a big piece
of the nonaspirin pain reliever market from Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol, which Datril said has about a 95
percent share.
And Bristol-Myers, maker of Datril, thinks it knows how to do it - by pricing.
It worked in test markets soon after Johnson & Johnson, which previously had only advertised Tylenol to
physicians, began its promotion to the public in 1974. But when Datril tried to take its cheaper-product concept
national, Johnson & Johnson dropped the price on Tylenol and Datril lost the advantage, according to D. John
Loden, director of marketing for analgesics at Bristol-Myers. Mr. Loden does not believe Johnson & Johnson will
pull that this time as Extra Strength Datril challenges Extra Strength Tylenol,
Datril must have been whipped pretty badly because it did not mount a major ad program for four years, until last
December, when it came back fairly strongly when its competitor was having its tampering troubles. Now it is
going to spend $1.5 million on network TV in two weeks and then another $1.5 million in the next four.
Friday it will break an almost separate ''educational'' campaign in six major markets. It will feature full-page
newspaper ads with a coupon offer of a booklet to explain acetaminophen, the active ingredient in both products.
Once people realize that the same amount of the drug is available in both and that Extra Strength Datril sells at
from 25 percent to 45 percent less, then greater numbers of them should try Datril. Or so Bristol-Myers believes.

STERLING TO TRY AGAIN WITH A NONASPIRIN DRUG

For Sterling Drug Inc., the makers of Bayer aspirin, the recall of Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol last September
presented an unexpected opportunity. Sterling had for years been trying unsuccessfully to break Tylenol's grip on
the pain reliever market, and this sudden moment of vulnerability must have seemed just the right time for
Sterling to try again.
It was also an opportunity for the company to gain a foothold in the aspirin-free pain reliever market, something it
has been refusing to attempt in recent years despite a decline in demand for aspirin products.
Accordingly, analysts say, Sterling decided to introduce its Panadol drug, a nonaspirin pain reliever sold only
overseas for the past 25 years, into the United States next month. ''This marks a significant change in company
strategy,'' said David Crossen, an analyst at Smith Barney.
Typically, Sterling's chairman, W. Clark Wescoe, a physician, would not comment on the introduction of Panadol.
And Walter C. Camas, president of Glenbrook Laboratories, the drug division of Sterling, would say only that the
addition of Panadol to the company's line ''will provide the right over-the-counter pain reliever for almost every
need.'' Large Promotion Planned
But the company has allocated $100 million for the promotion of Panodol, its largest such budget ever, and it
clearly hopes to make more than a ripple. In particular, analysts say, Sterling's target is Tylenol.
There is a catch, however. Tylenol, in the six months since seven people died from ingesting capsules that were
laced with cyanide after having left the plant, has already recovered most of its market. Thus, analysts say, the
Panadol strategy may be an example of Sterling's coming up with too little, too late.
In 1978, Sterling tried to compete with Tylenol directly by introducing an aspirin-free Bayer. But the product failed
to take hold against its more heavily promoted competitors, Bristol-Myers' Datril, American Home Products'
Anacin 3, and, of course, Tylenol, the market leader, which had been introduced three years before. As it turned
out, the nonaspirin Bayer, which had become known throughout the industry as the ''nonproduct Bayer,'' had to
be withdrawn six months later. Direct Challenge
Next, having failed with its nonaspirin product, Sterling redoubled its efforts to push its aspirin products. Once
again, the target was Tylenol, and this time the campaign took the form of a direct challenge to Tylenol's
advertising claims.
When the ads seemed to suggest that doctors recommended Tylenol, Sterling responded with ads reading:
''Makers of Tylenol, shame on you!'' The ads contended that doctors do not recommend products by name but
simply say, ''Take an aspirin.'' Tylenol is not aspirin, the ads observed, and Bayer is.
The Bayer ads further attacked the aspirin-free ingredient in Tylenol, acetaminophen, as a potentially harmful
chemical that ''leading experts have expressed great concern about.''
In the industry, many believed that the Sterling ads backfired and only served to reinforce Tylenol, which later
grew to a $400 million profit center for Johnson & Johnson. In addition, analysts say, the ads left the impression
that Sterling was pro-aspirin and antiacetaminophen, despite the fact that Sterling also made acetaminophen
drugs like Panadol, which is 100 percent acetaminophen.
Page 30 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

Indeed, had Sterling not taken a stand against the nonaspirin drugs, analysts believe, it might have been able to
move more quickly into the nonaspirin market in the United States. ''They probably should have gotten into
acetaminophen years ago,'' said Kent Blair, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin. ''But, the reason was that Sterling is
aspirin.''
From the look of Sterling's Panadol ads, the company appears to be taking a conservative approach in bringing
the drug to the United States. The Panadol ads are straight-forward, without references to competitors. The ads
are also careful not to oversell Panadol. In the past, Sterling has been warned by the Fedeal Trade Commission
against promising consumers too much. Share of Market
The nonaspirin pain relievers, originally available only by prescription to people allergic to aspirin, have been sold
over the counter for 10 years. In recent years, their share of the overall market has been growing and is now
more than a third the size of aspirin's.
Bayer aspirin is Sterling's best-known drug. It also provides the bulk of the company's $230 million in annual
domestic proprietary product sales. Total sales from Sterling's six divisions amount to $1.8 billion.
''Sterling was possibly too loyal to Bayer,'' said Joseph Riccardo, an analyst at Bear Sterns. As the market shifted
toward nonaspirin products, Sterling remained committed to Bayer, a product name the company acquired after
the German concern Bayer A.G. lost the right to use it in the United States after World War I.
But recently, Sterling's loyalty to aspirin has apparently begun to cost it sales. Drug sales were up just 4 percent
in 1981, and last year, even with a new, coated Bayer aspirin, they were up even less, although the company
hasn't made public the 1982 figures for its proprietary drug division. As a whole, Sterling has announced that it
had zero growth for all of 1982.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON: NEW WOE

At about 1 P.M. last Friday, the chairman and president of Johnson & Johnson were meeting at the company's
headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., to watch a tape of a television interview shown the night before. In it a
Syracuse doctor described his severe reaction to the company's prescription pain reliever Zomax.
As they met, the stock market was apparently having its reaction. At 1:17 P.M., when the share price had fallen
by $2.25, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading. Later that day the company issued a statement: Of 15
million users, 1,100 had experienced side-effects and five had died. It also announced a recall that will cost $20
million in after-tax earnings this year.
For Johnson & Johnson, it was all too familiar. Last fall, news that poisoned Tylenol capsules had killed seven
people in the Chicago area also battered the company's stock and forced a recall, at a cost of $100 million. Those
deaths were linked to the poisoning of the capsules on store shelves. The company had just started to recover
with aggressive promotion and new packaging.
But the problem with Zomax -which like Tylenol is made by Johnson & Johnson's McNeil Pharmaceutical unit may be more difficult to solve. Two of the five deaths are directly attributable to the use of Zomax. And even
though these deaths may be the result of misuse, the incidence of adverse reactions is above normal, according
to Christopher Smith, a spokesman at the Food and Drug Administration.
Because the deaths raise a question about the safety of Zomax, it is possible it may not be reintroduced,
particularly if doctors lose confidence in it.
Zomax had a number of competitors, including UpJohn & Company's Motrin, which has the lion's share of the
market; Merck & Company's Clindril, and the Syntex Corporation's Annaprox. Johnson & Johnson itself is
awaiting F.D.A. approval of a drug called Suprofen, which is chemically related to Zomax. Until discussions with
the F.D.A. over labeling are completed, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said, the company could not say
when Zomax would return to the market.
In the meantime, the company is spending $40 million to buy back supplies of Zomax from pharmacies, hospitals
and patients. The company said that containers with less than six months left on the expiration date would be
destroyed. Mailgrams and letters are also going out to doctors, dentists and retail outlets where the drug is
available. And for consumers who have questions, McNeil opened a special telephone line last Friday. The
Strength of Morphine
The problems with Zomax are a grave disappointment for Johnson & Johnson. It had promoted the drug as one of
the best developed by McNeil in the last decade. Introduced in November 1980, Zomax offered the pain-relieving
strength of morphine without being addictive.
True to predictions, last year Zomax - the chemical zemepirac sodium, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent had sales of $83 million worldwide, $60 million of that in the United States. In 1982, when Johnson & Johnson's
basic business earned $2.54 a share, Tylenol lost 12 cents and Zomax added 10 cents. But now, Joseph
Riccardo of Bear, Stearns & Company, estimates that Zomax will cost Johnson & Johnson 10 cents a share in
1983.

Most analysts believe that the company's quick action on Zomax kept the stock from dropping further. It fell to $45
a share last Friday. After the Tylenol scare, it had dropped to $39. But as Tylenol recovered, the stock rose as
high as $51.
When trading was halted last Friday, company representatives began conferring with officals of the Food and
Drug Adminstration almost immediately. And Johnson & Johnson wasted no time in getting out the first of two
press releases, which explained that the company believed that the Syracuse interview had been the reason for
the stock activity. After less than an hour and a half, trading in the stock had resumed. It closed yesterday at
$45.875, down 37.5 cents.
Some analysts suggest that the market overreacted to the news about Zomax and that Johnson & Johnson was
forced to do more than was necessary to maintain its image and reassure its customers. ''I think Johnson &
Johnson took the most prudent approach to the problem by making the recall, but it was probably not necessary,''
Mr. Riccardo at Bear, Sterns said.
Though several analysts suggest that Johnson & Johnson will overcome the Zomax problem, others believe it will
hurt the company. ''There is something apparently wrong here,'' said David Saks, an analyst at A.G. Becker Inc.
''It's one thing to have side-effects, but its another thing to have a fatality.''

JOHNSON &JOHNSON, the leading US pharmaceutical group, expects that product returns and expenses
resulting from the decision temporarily to withdraw worldwide distribution of its prescription drug, Zomax, will
reduce after-tax earnings by about Dollars 20m this year.
This is the second heavy blow to the group's earnings arising from a largescale product recall in the space of just
over five months.
In October, Johnson &Johnson recalled its big-selling Tylenol capsules from the US market, after seven residents
in the Chicago area died after taking capsules that had had been laced with cyanide. At the time, Johnson
&Johnson said the probable cost of the recall would be around Dollars 100m.
Zomax is a less important product, although it has still been an important revenue earner with worldwide sales in
1982 of Dollars 82m. The group said yesterday that as well as the direct cost of the recall, the loss of sales
revenue on the product would have an additional adverse impact on this year's earnings.
Johnson &Johnson earned wide-spread praise for its prompt reaction to the Tylenol tragedy. The capsules were
tampered with outside the group's manufacturing facilities, and with the help of an aggressive marketing
programme the group has already gone a long way towards re-establishing the product's leading market position.
The Zomax case is quite different, in that the product has been linked with serious and in some cases fatal side
effects. The group's sales in 1982 amounted to Dollars 5.8bn, and its net income after tax came to Dollars
523.4m, before an extraordinary charge of Dollars 50m after tax stemming from the Tylenol withdrawal.
Johnson &Johnson's shares had been performing strongly in recent weeks, but this second blow to earnings has
sent them sharply lower in the past few days. They were trading in the early afternoon yesterday at Dollars 45
5/8, compared with Dollars 50 1/4 last Thursday.
Carla Rapoport writes from London: Ortho-Cliag, a Johnson &Johnson subsidiary in the UK, said yesterday that it
had agreed with the UK Department of Health and Social Services to withdraw Zomax from the British market.
British sales are believed to be worth about Pounds 2m (Dollars 3m).

Johnson & Johnson Removes Another Drug After Deaths

Following reports of five deaths from allergic reactions to the popular prescription painkiller Zomax, its
manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson Products Inc., said yesterday that it was "temporarily withdrawing" the drug
from the market.
Spokesmen for the company and the Food and Drug Administration said the action was taken voluntarily, and not
at the government's urging, until stronger warning labels can be completed for physicians who prescribe the drug.
Johnson & Johnson had been struggling, with surprising success, to regain public confidence in its products since
last fall, when it temporarily pulled its over-the-counter Tylenol capsules off the shelves because of
product-tampering that killed seven people in the Chicago area. Tylenol capsules were recently reintroduced in
tamper-proof packaging.
The effect of the Zomax publicity on the New Brunswick, N.J., company is uncertain, but one government source
suggested that yesterday's quick decision to pull the drug off the market temporarily was taken because of
"sensitivity over the lingering Tylenol problem."
In a pattern similiar to that used with Tylenol, Johnson & Johnson said, "We request that any consumer having
Zomax return the drug to the drugstore." A spokesman said the company will reimburse pharmacists for
repurchasing the drug from consumers.
Johnson & Johnson has been meeting with FDA officials to toughen the labeling on Zomax, which has been
marketed since October, 1980. Since its introduction, Zomax has been prescribed to more than 15 million patients
to relieve moderate to severe pain, the company said. Surveillance of side effects revealed about 1,100 allergic
reactions, it added.
"The severity of these reactions has ranged from mild rash to anaphylaxis. This includes five deaths, two in
patients known to be sensitive to aspirin," said company spokesman Robert Andrews. Anaphylaxis is a swift,
life-threatening physical reaction that occurs when the body's defense system has an allergic overreaction to a
substance.
FDA spokesman Christopher Smith said two of the people who died were from Massachusetts, and the other
three were from North Dakota, Kansas and New York. He said he did not know their names or ages, but said the
first death occurred a "little over a year ago."
Smith emphasized that the adverse effects were "rare. We think the problem can be solved with more adequate
labeling to alert physicians about the problem." A spokesman for the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary that makes
Zomax said that doctors and pharmacies should receive official notice of the withdrawal by Monday.
Zomax's label was changed earlier to strengthen the allergy warning, and the FDA's Smith said that company
officials met as recently as last week to work on an update.
He noted that many other drugs, including penicillin, may produce severe allergic responses, but added that the
FDA was concerned about "how widely this drug has been prescribed," for everything from "menstrual cramps to
severe headaches."
It is popular, he said, because it offers an alternative to drugs with codeine, such as prescription Tylenol, which
have the potential for addiction.

Yesterday's decision to pull Zomax off the market for the time being followed a stock market scramble in which
Johnson & Johnson's stock dropped in the early afternoon, when trading in the issue on the New York Stock
Exchange was halted temporarily. The stock closed at $48, down $2.25 for the day. In markets elsewhere, it went
as low as $45.
The activity apparently came in response to rumors about problems with Zomax after a broadcast Thursday night
by a Syracuse, N.Y., television station about the five deaths.
Zomax is produced by McNeil Pharmaceutical, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary in Spring House, Pa.
Tylenol is produced by another subsidiary, McNeil Consumer Products, in Fort Washington, Pa.

NEWARK, Feb 28 -- Vernon Williams Jr., of East Orange, was sentenced today to a two-year prison term for mail
fraud for attempting to extort $100,000 from the manufacturer of Tylenol by threatening to put cyanide in the
medicine.
Federal District Judge Dickenson Debevoise handed down the sentence.
''I was under a lot of pressure and needed money,'' Mr. Williams told the judge when he pleaded guilty on Jan. 19.
Mr. Williams, who is 34 years old and unemployed, was convicted of writing an extortion letter to Johnson and
Johnson last October.
Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were led to Mr. Williams by his two young sons, who thought they were
picking up the extortion money.
Mr. Williams said he devised the scheme after seeing news reports about seven Chicago-area people who died
after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules that contained cyanide.

Johnson & Johnson, reflecting the effects of the Tylenol recall and its attempt to return the product to the market,
reported yesterday that its net income in the fourth fiscal quarter dropped 10.5 percent.
The New Brunswick, N.J., health-care company said that net income in the latest three months ended Jan. 2 fell
to $79.4 million, or 42 cents a share, from $88.7 million, or 48 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1981. Sales
were a scant seven-tenths of 1 percent lower, at $1.38 billion, compared with $1.39 billion in the 1981 three
months.
Although Johnson & Johnson did not detail how Tylenol recovery costs sults, analysts said that for the period a
decline of more than $25 million in domestic earnings was due to Tylenol.
For all of the fiscal year 1982, Johnson & Johnson reported earnings of $473.4 million, or $2.52 a share, up 1.2
percent, from $467.6 million, or $2.51 a share, in the preceding 12 months. Sales rose 6.7 percent, to $5.76
billion, from $5.40 billion.
Johnson & Johnson said that it incurred an extraordinary after-tax charge of $50 million, or 27 cents a share,
stemming from the withdrawal of Tylenol capsule products last fall following seven deaths attributed to poisoned
Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules. Hewlett-Packard
The Hewlett-Packard Company, the nation's largest producer of electronic test and measurement instruments and
a major manufacturer of minicomputers, reported yesterday that net income in its first fiscal quarter of 1983 ended
Jan. 31 rose 16.4 percent, to $85 million, or 67 cents a share, from $73 million, or 59 cents a share, in the
corresponding quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 13.2 percent, to $1.06 billion, from $936 million.
''First-quarter results reflect no significant improvement in the overall business climate in the United States and in
other countries where Hewlett-Packard does much of its business,'' said John A. Young, the Palo Alto, Calif.,
company's president and chief executive officer. ''Our order growth over the first quarter of 1982 was quite
modest.''
He said, however that, despite the continued gloomy economy, all four of Hewlett's business segments showed
increases in orders for the first quarter. The computer products segment - formerly called electronic data products
- was up 5 percent, electronic test and measurement rose 8 percent, medical electronic equipment notched a 20
percent gain, and analytical instrumentation ended up 6 percent higher. Eaton Corp.
The Eaton Corporation, a major producer of truck and automobile parts, reported yesterday that it had a loss of
$227.4 million in the fourth quarter in contrast to earnings of $20.3 million, or 74 cents a share, in the
corresponding quarter a year earlier. Sales fell 16.7 percent, to $569.8 million, from $684 million.
For the full year, the Cleveland-based company said that it had a deficit of $189.6 million, in contrast to earnings
of $82.4 million in 1981. Sales dropped 13.7 percent, to $2.45 billion, from $2.84 billion.
''Throughout 1982, virtually all of Eaton's markets weakened dramatically,'' said E.M. de Windt, the company's
chairman and chief executive. ''Vehicle components markets experienced new lows during the second half, and
the capital goods markets continued to stagnate. The single source of strength was a robust electronics business,
which increased in volume by 50 percent.

Eaton's fiancial results were also significantly affected by the action the company took on Jan. 26, 1983,
regarding restructuring of the corporation.
The loss for the year, Eaton's first since 1933, resulted from an aftertax provision of $199.8 million, or $7.07 a
share, for the discontinuance of the company's Materials Handling Vehicles segment, and for costs associated
with the closing of several plants in Eaton's continuing operations.

International Companies: Product recall worries US insurers

Financial Times

US INSURERS were sent into a flutter last week by news of a lawsuit which could have important implications for
their product liability business. McNeilab, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, has sued a group of insurance
companies for about Dollars 117m to cover the cost of the company's recall of its Tylenol products.
In a three-day period last autumn, seven people died in the Chicago area after allegedly taking Tylenol pain
relieving capsules which had been laced with cyanide.
The tragedy attracted nationwide attention. It soon became clear that the products had not been tampered with
before they left the compay, but it was decided to stop producing the capsules and to recall and destroy all those
on the market. The company has put the cost of this at about Dollars 100m.
In the papers filed in connection with the lawsuit, the company says that once it had become aware of the
poisonings, any failure to recall the products could have been claimed as neglegent omission, constituting a
proximate cause of any further poisoning. Thus it was 'obligated by reason of such potential liability to effect a
prompt withdrawal of said Tylenol capsules.'
In essence, Johnson and Johnson is saying that if it had done nothing, the company - and its insurers - could
have been hit for millions of dollars in potential bodily injury lawsuits. It is asking its insurers to share the burden
of its action.
Although its property and liability policies do not include specific coverage for product recall, the company says its
policies do not bar it from making such claims.
Product recall is apparently excluded from its liability policies, but Johnson and Johnson claims that this exclusion
is not applicable since it is based on the idea that the product concerned is faulty. That, it says, was not the case
with the Tylenol capsules which left its doors.
There are two parts to the lawsuit. In the first, the company is seeking to recover about Dollars 67m of its costs
under a number of excess and product liability policies. If it is successful, insurers say, the scope of product
liability insurance will have been significantly widened.
In a second claim, the company is seeking to recover money under an all risk policy which, among other things,
provides cover against business interruption losses and extra expenses connected with such interruptions.
The court papers make clear that the claim is not just an attempt to cover the loss of business caused by the halt
in Tylenol production. It includes 'withdrawal expenses incurred under the first claim for relief in the event that
such withdrawal expenses are adjudicated not to be recovered from the product liability insurers.'
The company notified its insurers in November of its intended claims, and has not yet had any response from
them. Hence the publication last week of the details of its suit. A lot of fine print is certain to be examined before
this one is over.
* A guide to the funding issues related to the asbestos crisis has been published in New York by the National
Council on Compensation Insurance. It warns that the liabilities arising from asbestos-associated disease are
threatening the basis of the workers' compensation system as well as the US tort system.
'The asbestos problem will have to be resolved in a way which differs from its current handling, and it will have to
be resolved in relatively short order,' the report concludes.

Meanwhile, Lloyd's of London has joined 11 major asbestos insurers - including Royal and the Commercial Union
- to set up the Asbestos Claims Council. The objective is to co-ordinate the growing number of asbestos-related
claims and speed their disposition.
* Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, had some mildly comforting thoughts
last week for those who fear that deregulation in the US financial services industry will hurt the established
insurance industry.
He told the annual conference of the Insurance Information Institute and the Insurance Services Office that his
bank would like to have the opportunity to underwrite property and casualty insurance. But, he said: 'That is quite
different from saying that I would hang out our shingle (nameplate) tomorrow and the same would apply to
insurance brokerage.
'I guess what I'm saying is that much of the current talk about the potential of financial supermarkets may be
greatly exaggerated.'

The suit is based on the premise that had Johnson and Johnson not recalled Tylenol last year, when a number of
cases of poisoning occured, the company and its insurers could have been faced with bodily injury lawsuits
costing many millions of dollars.
Liability policies do not cover product recall, but the company claims that this exclusion does not apply in this
case, only where the product is faulty.
The suit is being presented in two parts. The first seeks to recover $67m costs under excess and product liability
policies. A successful suit could, it is thought, widen the scope of product liability insurance. The second seeks to
recover costs under an all risk policy. This claim covers both loss of business and "withdrawal expenses incurred
under the first claim for relief in the event that such withdrawal expenses are adjudicated not to be recovered from
the product liability insurers".

N.Y. -DJ- MCNEILAB INC., A UNIT OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON, SUED ITS INSURERS FOR ABOUT $117
MILLION TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE COMPANY'S NATIONWIDE RECALL LAST FALL OF ITS
TYLENOL PRODUCTS.
IN A SUIT FILED IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEWARK, N.J., MCNEILAB NAMED NINE INSURANCE
COMPANIES AS DEFENDANTS. THE COMPANY SAYS THE INSURERS SHOULD PAY BOTH THE ACTUAL
COST OF THE RECALL AS WELL AS EXPENSES OF "BUSINESS INTERRUPTION," SUCH AS PROFIT LOST
WHILE THE PRODUCT WAS ABSENT FROM STORE SHELVES.
IN THE SUIT, MCNEILAB ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST $60 MILLION OF ITS RECALL COSTS ARE
RECOVERABLE THROUGH ITS PRODUCT-LIABILITY COVERAGE. THE COMPANY BASES THIS CLAIM ON
THE BELIEF THAT IF IT HADN'T REMOVED MORE THAN 30 MILLION BOTTLES OF EXTRA-STRENGTH
TYLENOL FROM THE MARKET, IT AND ITS INSURERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIT WITH "UNTOLD MILLIONS"
OF DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL BODILY INJURY LAWSUITS FROM TYLENOL USERS, SAID GREGORY L.
DISKANT, A LAWYER FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON.
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO ARGUE THAT JOHNSON & JOHNSON "SHOULD HAVE DONE NOTHING (AND)
LET PEOPLE DIE" IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS COSTS WOULD BE COVERED BY THE
COMPANY'S PRODUCT-LIABILITY INSURERS, SAID DISKANT, A PARTNER IN THE NEW YORK LAW FIRM
OF PATTERSON, BELKNAP, WEBB & TYLER.
INSURANCE-INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID THE CLAIM WAS UNUSUAL AND HINGED ON QUESTIONABLE
LEGAL LOGIC. "MCNEIL SEEMS TO BE SAYING THAT IF IT HADN'T PULLED THE PRODUCT IT WOULD
HAVE HAD TO PAY DAMAGES IN LIABILITY SUITS," SAID AN OFFICIAL AT ONE LARGE INSURANCE
BROKERAGE CONCERN. "THAT MEANS THE COMPANY IS SAYING IT MIGHT BE LIABLE AND IT'S BEEN
MAINTAINING ALL ALONG THAT IT WASN'T."
MCNEILAB IS A HOLDING COMPANY FOR MCNEIL PHARMACEUTICAL AND MCNEIL CONSUMER
PRODUCTS CO. THE LATTER COMPANY MAKES AND MARKETS TYLENOL'S VARIOUS
OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS.
IN LATE OCTOBER, JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAID THE COST OF RECALLING THE TYLENOL WOULD BE
ABOUT $100 MILLION. THE RECALL COSTS RESULTED IN A $50 MILLION AFTER-TAX CHARGE AGAINST
THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS.
DISKANT SAID MCNEILAB'S INSURERS SO FAR HAVE FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE COMPANY'S
INSURANCE CLAIMS, FILED BEFORE THE SUITS, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVEN'T REJECTED THEM.
MCNEILAB FILED THE SUIT IN LATE NOVEMBER, BUT IT WASN'T SERVED TO THE INSURANCE FIRMS
UNTIL LATE LAST WEEK. NONE OF THE NINE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE WILLING TO COMMENT
ON THE SUIT.
THE RECALL, CONSIDERED ONE OF THE LARGEST IN MARKETING HISTORY, RESULTED FROM THE
DEATHS IN LATE SEPTEMBER OF SEVEN CHICAGO-AREA RESIDENTS WHO WERE POISONED BY
TAKING CYANIDE-LACED EXTRA-STRENGTH TYLENOL CAPSULES.

N.Y. -DJ- IN ITS SUIT AGAINST NINE INSURERS, JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S MCNEILAB UNIT IS SEEKING
TWO SEPARATE CLAIMS. THE FIRST IS AIMED AT RECOVERING THE COST OF THE RECALL FROM
EIGHT INSURERS WHO PROVIDED EXCESS LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR MCNEILAB. THOUGH THE
COMPANY SAYS THE COST OF WITHDRAWING THE PRODUCT WILL BE ABOUT $100 MILLION, IT
EXPECTS THAT ONLY ABOUT $67 MILLION WOULD BE RECOVERABLE THROUGH INSURANCE.
IN ITS SECOND CLAIM, MCNEILAB IS SEEKING $50 MILLION FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND OTHER
EXPENSES UNDER AN "ALL-RISK" PROPERTY POLICY UNDERWRITTEN BY AFFILIATED FM INSURANCE
CO., A UNIT OF ALLENDALE MUTUAL INSURANCE CO.
MCNEILAB SAID THAT BUSINESS-INTERRUPTION COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE LOWER PROFIT AND FIXED
CHARGES INCURRED DURING THE TIME TYLENOL WAS OFF THE MARKET, WILL EXCEED THE $50
MILLION LIMIT ON THE AFFILIATED FM POLICY. THE ALL-RISK POLICY PROVIDES COVERAGE NOT
INCLUDED UNDER THE COMPANY'S REGULAR PROPERTY-DAMAGE POLICIES.
MIDDLESEX ASSURANCE CO., A BERMUDA-BASED "CAPTIVE" INSURANCE COMPANY OWNED BY
JOHNSON & JOHNSON, UNDERWRITES THE FIRST $5 MILLION OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S
PRODUCT-LIABILITY COVERAGE. COVERAGE ABOVE THAT LIMIT IS PROVIDED BY A SERIES OF
EXCESS AND UMBRELLA-PRODUCT-LIABILITY POLICIES UNDERWRITTEN BY MIDDLESEX AND EIGHT
OTHER INSURERS.
WHILE MANY UMBRELLA LIABILITY POLICIES SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE PRODUCT-RECALL EXPENSES,
JOHNSON & JOHNSON LAWYER DISKANT SAID MCNEILAB'S POLICIES DON'T BAR CLAIMS BY JOHNSON
& JOHNSON FOR COSTS OF THE TYLENOL RECALL.
MCNEILAB'S LARGEST CLAIM, $19.9 MILLION, IS AGAINST NORTH RIVER INSURANCE CO. THE

N.Y. -DJ- STERLING DRUG INC., TAKING AIM AT JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S TYLENOL, SAID IT WILL
INTRODUCE DOMESTICALLY ITS TOP-SELLING OVERSEAS ASPIRIN-FREE PAIN RELIEVER, PANADOL,
"IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS."
FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS, STERLING, WHICH ALSO MAKES BAYER ASPIRIN, HAS MARKETED
PANADOL IN BRITAIN, WHERE IT IS THE NO. 1 SELLING PAIN RELIEVER, AND ABOUT 70 OTHER
COUNTRIES.
PANADOL IS WELL-POSITIONED TO COMPETE AGAINST TYLENOL BECAUSE IT CONTAINS THE SAME
ASPIRIN-FREE INGREDIENT, ACETAMINOPHEN, AND IT IS BACKED BY A LARGE COMPANY WITH
ABUNDANT MARKETING RESOURCES. ALSO, BOTH PRODUCTS CONTAIN 500 MILLIGRAMS OF THE
INGREDIENT.
TWO-THIRDS OF TYLENOL USERS PREFER ACETAMINOPHEN OVER ASPIRIN BECAUSE OF ITS
GENTLENESS TO THE STOMACH. IN ADDITION, TYLENOL'S SAFETY REPUTATION HAS BEEN
THREATENED BY THE DEATHS LAST OCTOBER OF SEVEN CHICAGO-AREA RESIDENTS FROM
CYANIDE-LACED CAPSULES OF TYLENOL.
BUT STERLING MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE PANADOL HERE IN 1975, WHEN TYLENOL
BEGAN ACETAMINOPHEN'S FIRST-EVER ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN TO CONSUMERS. FOR THE PAST
YEAR, EXECUTIVES AT STERLING HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING BRINGING PANADOL HERE.
STERLING SAID YESTERDAY IT WILL INTRODUCE A NEW FORM OF ITS BAYER ASPIRIN, THE OLDEST
PAIN RELIVER ON THE MARKET. IT WILL BE MAXIMUN-STRENGTH BAYER ASPIRIN, TABLETS OF WHICH
WILL CONTAIN 500 MILLIGRAMS OF ASPIRIN, INSTEAD OF 325 MILLIGRAMS. IN ADDITION, STERLING
SAID IT WOULD "RELAUNCH," OR PUT MORE ADVERTISING MONEY BEHIND, ITS ARTHRITIS BAYER
TIME-RELEASED ASPIRIN TABLETS.
THE MOVES BY STERLING PLUNGES IT EVEN DEEPER INTO THE FIERCELY COMPETITIVE
PAIN-RELIEVER MARKET IN THE U.S., WHICH HAS BEEN IN A STATE OF FLUX SINCE THE POISONINGS
TOPPLED TYLENOL FROM ITS NO. 1 PERCH.
IN ADDITION TO THE STERLING INTRODUCTIONS, SCHERING-PLOUGH CORP. PLANS THIS MONTH TO
INTRODUCE A BRAND OF ACETAMINOPHEN, ST. JOSEPH'S ASPIRIN-FREE TABLETS FOR ADULTS.
WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS WERE INFORMED OF THE STERLING PLANS IN LATE NOVEMBER. "IT'S
GOING TO HAVE A VERY EXCITING IMPACT ON THE ANALGESIC MARKET. THEY'RE SUPPORTING IT
WITH A VERY, VERY AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN,' SAID SUSAN MONTONNA, DIRECTOR OF
MERCHANDISING AT THE DRUG-DISTRIBUTION UNIT OF FOREMOST-MCKESSON INC., THE NATION'S
LARGEST WHOLESALE DRUG SUPPLIER. STERLING DECLINED TO SAY HOW MUCH IT WAS SPENDING
ON THE CAMPAIGN.
BUT STERLING'S PANADOL ENTRY WILL BE EXPENSIVE IF IT IS TO SUCCEED. TYPICALLY, COMPANIES
MUST SPEND HALF TO TWO-THIRDS OF A NEW BRAND'S FIRST-YEAR SALES ON ADVERTISING AND
PROMOTION TO MAKE A DENT IN THE $1.2 BILLION PAIN-RELIVER MARKET.
AND SOME MARKETERS QUESTION THE TIMING OF STERLING'S MOVE. ALREADY TYLENOL HAS
REGAINED MORE THAN HALF ITS TOTAL SALES IN THE POISONINGS' AFTERMATH. AND THE BRAND'S
POPULAR CAPSULE FORM IS BEING REINTRODUCED WITH STRONG AD SUPPORT THIS MONTH.
CAPSULES HAD ACCOUNTED FOR 40% OF TYLENOL'S SALES.

James W. Lewis has not been charged with planting the cyanide that killed seven people who took Tylenol in the
Chicago area last fall, but he is accused of trying to make a bundle from their deaths. In a Federal court in
Chicago last week, he pleaded not guilty to a charge that he tried to extort $1 million from the painkiller's
manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, with an offer to ''stop the killing'' in return for the cash.
Earlier, investigators said that Mr. Lewis, who had been the object of a nationwide search in the aftermath of the
deaths, was not suspected of actually filling the Tylenol capsules with poison. Meanwhile, his wife, Leann, was
released from jail after her bond was reduced from $5 million to $100,000. The charges against her are unrelated
to the Tylenol murders.

WHEN the Tylenol poison scare erupted in September, the attention of investors focused initially on the
manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, and on other companies whose over-the-counter analgesics might claim
Tylenol's market share. But as the scare spread to other products, talk of tamper-proofing spurred investment
interest in the companies that sell packaging.
Analysts who follow the packaging industry say they were deluged with inquiries from investors. Indeed, the flurry
of interest increased the price of at least three stocks: the West Company, a Phoenixville, Pa., producer of rubber,
metal and plastic packaging products for the pharmaceutical industry; Dougherty Brothers, a small manufacturer
of plastic containers for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, based in Buena, N.J., and Paco Pharmaceutical
Services of Lakewood, N.J., also a supplier of packaging to the pharmaceutical and health-care industries.
In recent weeks, however, the flurry has subsided as the financial community has taken a hard look at the
potential for a boom in packaging that makes it evident if tampering has occurred. And despite periodic new
alarms - the latest only last week, with the discovery in California of cyanide-laced Anacin capsules - it appears
increasingly unlikely that most suppliers of packaging will find a silver lining in the packaged goods companies'
storm cloud.
That situation could change dramatically if manufacturers of health and beauty items, and the huge food and
beverage industry, decide to leap onto the tamper-evident packaging bandwagon. But so far, tamperproofing has
been confined mainly to over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.
''Most of these drugs are already packaged, so we're not talking about a new market, only an improved one,'' said
Richard Palm of Merrill Lynch. ''Proportionately, gains in packaging revenues will be fairly modest.'' Edward H.
Schollmeyer, a container industry analyst for Paine Webber, who also serves on the board of the Peerless Tube
Company - a supplier of the aluminum tube with aluminum membrane used by Johnson & Johnson's K-Y jelly
-noted with surprise that Peerless received only a few inquiries following the Tylenol deaths.
Nor has the American Can Company been overwhelmed with inquiries about tamper-proofing its glaminate tube,
used extensively for toothpaste. On the contrary, Mr. Schollmeyer said, toothpaste manufacturers, rather than
adopting a protective membrane, are planning to glue shut their paperboard cartons.
''The question is, how much can we protect the consumer, how much does the consumer want to be protected
and how much will it cost?'' Mr. Schollmeyer said. For the present, analysts noted, many packaged goods
companies, mindful of consumer resistance toward higher prices, have selected the least expensive route.
Most of the suppliers of packaging are large companies that would benefit only marginally from increased
demand by the drug companies for film wrappers, plastic ''blister'' or ''bubble'' packs, or aluminum or paper
membranes. While glass packaging suppliers such as Anchor Hocking and Brockway may get some sales
growth, such incremental revenue will not rescue an industry burdened with excess capacity and fierce price
competition, analysts said.
Smaller, more specialized companies offer better investment opportunities. Most noteworthy is Paco, which
responded quickly to the tampering scare, bringing out last October five new tamperresistant packages for
pharmaceutical and health and beauty aids packagers. Of the 11 types of tamper-evident packaging
recommended by the trade association of over-the-counter drug manufacturers, only one - the aerosol can - is not
sold by Paco.

Paco's largest customer is Johnson & Johnson, which accounted for about 30 percent of its business in the fiscal
year 1981. Paco's stock, which is traded over-the-counter, jumped into the $40-plus range last month, and has
sustained its gain. Following a 3-for-2 split, it closed yesterday at $27.75 bid. The current price may already
anticipate a windfall from tamper-effective packaging demand, said Randolph Ross of Kidder, Peabody.
Dougherty, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, reached $14.375 a share in the Tylenol aftermath
and closed yesterday at $10.125. West, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, rose to $22.785 a
share, but closed yesterday at $19.625. While West might exploit the tamper-effective packaging market, Mr.
Ross suggested, it might do better to develop its higher-margin hospitalproducts business.

CHICAGO, Dec. 28 -- James W. Lewis, a key figure in the investigation of seven Tylenol-cyanide deaths,
pleaded not guilty today to Federal extortion charges.
Mr. Lewis, who was arraigned before Federal District Judge John Nordberg, is accused of attempting to extort $1
million from Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of the manufacturer of Tylenol, to ''stop the killing.'' Seven
residents of the Chicago area died last fall after swallowing capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol that had been
filled with cyanide.
Mr. Lewis was composed in his 10-minute court appearance and waived the reading of the indictment. A status
hearing was scheduled for Feb. 14.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Dec. 27 -- Johnson & Johnson said today that next week it will begin the first
nationwide television advertising for Extra-Strength Tylenol since seven people died in the Chicago area after
taking cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules.
A television commercial, to be broadcast on Sunday, features a housewife describing Tylenol as a trusted family
product. It then details the new triple-sealed containers. The advertisement is part of an aggressive campaign to
re-establish Tylenol as a major brand.

Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that its Tylenol analgesic brand had regained much of the market that it lost
this fall when seven Chicago-area residents died from taking cyanide-contaminated Extra-Strength Tylenol
capsules.
A company spokesman said that both the company's own research and outside surveys showed that Tylenol now
has 24 percent of the market for pain relievers, compared with a 35 percent share before the Chicago tragedy.
Most of the recent sales have been in tablet form, however.
Shortly after the Chicago tragedy, said Lawrence G. Foster, the company's vice president for public relations, ''We
lost 87 percent of our market. But by mid-December, our surveys show that we had gotten back 67 percent of our
original market. The product is coming back faster and stronger than we ever anticipated.'' Coupon Campaign
Johnson & Johnson disregarded conventional marketing wisdom in responding to the Tylenol deaths. Instead of
keeping a low profile - and perhaps even withdrawing the brand - the company set out to win back customers with
a huge coupon campaign offering free Tylenol capsules or pills.
It was not known how much of the rising Tylenol sales could be attributed to the coupon offer, but millions of
coupons were distributed in newspaper advertising as part of the marketing campaign that began in November.
Benjamin Lipstein, a marketing professor at the New York University Graduate School of Business, who
suggested in October that Johnson & Johnson ''withhold advertising and reduce public awareness'' of Tylenol,
said yesterday that he now believes the company's more aggressive approach was ''a smart and courageous
decision.'' A Working Strategy
''The fact that the numbers are coming back in the way they are is remarkable,'' he said. ''Some marketers would
have chosen to give the brand up. But this strategy seems to be working.''
Leo Shapiro, a Chicago-based market researcher who has conducted independent studies on consumer reaction
to the Tylenol deaths, said that two things happened to Tylenol, which is now being marketed in new
tamper-resistant packaging.
''It very quickly became apparent that the company wasn't at fault and the retailers weren't at fault,'' he said. ''And
secondly, the company acted in a very forthright manner. They immediately said, 'Don't use Tylenol,' and they
took the product back from the store.
''They played it squeaky straight,'' he added, ''and followed the first rule of these things - never put consumers in a
position where they have to make a choice about the risk.'' Attitudes Seen Shifting
In a survey Mr. Shapiro conducted immediately after the Tylenol deaths, 45 percent of the respondents said they
would definitely use Tylenol again, 13 percent said they might, and 43 percent said they definitely would not.
Four days later, asked the same question, 52 percent said they would, 33 percent said they might, and 17 percent
said they definitely would not use Tylenol again, Mr. Shapiro reported. And by two weeks after the incident, 78
percent said they would use Tylenol again, 13 said they might, and only 9 percent said they would not.
''Essentially, after about four days, the people who said definitely not switched to maybe, then after another week,
they said yes,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''It was a sharp scare, but it passed quickly.''

JOHNSON & JOHNSON APPEARS TO HAVE PULLED OFF A MARKETING MIRACLE. IN THE DAYS
FOLLOWING TYLENOL'S LINK TO SEVERAL CHICAGO-AREA DEATHS, MARKETING EXPERTS WERE
QUICK TO COMPOSE ELEGIES. BUT LESS THAN THREE MONTHS LATER, TYLENOL IS CLOSE TO
RECOUPING ITS LOST BUSINESS.
PRELIMINARY INDUSTRY DATA SHOW THAT AFTER DROPPING SHARPLY IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS
FOLLOWING THE POISONINGS, TYLENOL'S SHARE OF THE $1.2 BILLION A-YEAR PAIN-RELIEF
BUSINESS HAS COME ROARING BACK. INFORMATION RESOURCES INC., WHICH SURVEYS SALES IN
GROCERY OUTLETS IN FOUR U.S. TOWNS, CLAIMS TYLENOL HAS RECAPTURED AN ASTOUNDING 95%
OF ITS PRIOR MARKET SHARE. IN THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER ALONE, TYLENOL'S SHARE
CLIMBED BY 47%, ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE CURRENT VOLUME REPRESENTS FREE PACKAGES
PROVIDED TO WIN BACK CONSUMERS.
DAVID E. COLLINS, CHAIRMAN OF MCNEIL CONSUMER PRODUCTS, THE J&J UNIT RESPONSIBLE FOR
TYLENOL, SAYS THAT WHILE THOSE NUMBERS "ARE ENCOURAGING, THEY AREN'T PROJECTABLE
NATIONALLY YET." DATA FROM OTHER SURVEYS INDICATE THAT TYLENOL HAD REGAINED 55% OF
ITS MARKET SHARE BY THE END OF NOVEMBER, UP FROM 20% A MONTH BEFORE. THESE FIGURES
REFLECT ONLY SALES OF THE COMPANY'S TABLETS, SINCE CAPSULES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 40%
OF TYLENOL SALES, WERE PULLED OFF THE MARKET AND ARE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO
REAPPEAR.
BUT, SAYS COLLINS, THE INFORMATION RESOURCES NUMBERS ARE IMPORTANT. "THEY INDICATE A
TREND WE NOW BELIEVE IS TRUE." VOLUME HAS COME BACK "VERY, VERY STRONG, MUCH
STRONGER THAN ANYONE HERE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED," HE ADDS.
MUCH OF THE RECENT SURGE MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MARKETING BLITZ IN WHICH MCNEIL
HAS GIVEN AWAY MILLIONS OF COUPONS WORTH $2.50, THE PRICE OF A SMALL BOTTLE OF TYLENOL.
EVEN SO, OBSERVERS ARE STARTLED BY THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH TYLENOL HAS BEEN
RESURRECTED. THE RECOVERY, THEY SAY, OWES SOMETHING TO MCNEIL'S MARKETING SMARTS
BUT ALSO TO A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL CHANCE EVENTS AND THE APPARENTLY STRONG BOND
TYLENOL HAS FORGED WITH ITS CUSTOMERS.
IN LARGE MEASURE, TYLENOL'S COMEBACK RESULTED FROM AN EARLY MANAGEMENT DECISION
NOT TO LET THE BRAND DIE. JOHNSON & JOHNSON INITIALLY MADE THE DECISION BECAUSE OF THE
PRODUCT'S IMPORTANCE. SELLING AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF MORE THAN $450 MILLION, THE BRAND
WAS WORTH NEARLY $80 MILLION IN PROFITS, OR ABOUT 17% OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S
EARNINGS.
BY THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER, EXECUTIVES AT JOHNSON & JOHNSON REALIZED THAT ALTHOUGH
SALES CERTAINLY WERE DOWN, DAMAGE TO THE PRODUCT WASN'T NEARLY AS BAD AS IT FIRST
SEEMED. ACCORDING TO LEO SHAPIRO, WHOSE CHICAGO COMPANY INTERVIEWED CONSUMERS
DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF THE CRISIS, BY OCT. 17, ONLY 9% OF TYLENOL USERS SAID THEY
DEFINITELY WOULDN'T USE THE PRODUCT AGAIN, DOWN FROM 43% TWO WEEKS EARLIER.
APPARENTLY, JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S OWN SURVEYS WERE UNCOVERING SIMILAR DATA.
STUDENTS OF MARKETING NOW SAY THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT REASONS FOR THE QUICK
TURNAROUND IN CONSUMER SENTIMENT. THE PUBLIC, THEY REASON, QUICKLY UNDERSTOOD THAT
UNLIKE PREVIOUS PRODUCT-RELATED TRAGEDIES, TYLENOL WASN'T AT FAULT. MOREOVER, A RASH

Tylenol: Signs of a Recovery; Johnson & Johnson Even Turns Experts Around

It looks like the experts were wrong about Tylenol.
Immediately after seven deaths in Chicago were linked to cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules, marketing specialists
and Wall Street analysts confidently predicted the rapid demise of the nation's largest-selling over-the-counter
pain reliever.
The only marketing strategy for Tylenol, they said, was to cancel all advertising to reduce brand awareness, and
hope that time would help diminish the grim connection that was planted in the consumer's mind on Sept. 30.
Now many analysts agree that Tylenol will regain its dominant position, although they differ on how long it will
take the company to reach its old sales volume.
Last week, officials at Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of McNeil Consumer Products Co., which makes
Tylenol, said its factories were working around the clock to meet the demand for Tylenol capsules in new
tamper-resistant packaging.
"Initial orders have exceeded anything we anticipated," said Wayne K. Nelson, a Johnson & Johnson group
chairman and former president of McNeil. "We're selling everything we can make, and by March or April, I think
we'll be the No. 1 brand again."
While the merchandisers placing the orders may be issuing their decision on Tylenol, the consumer verdict is still
out. Tylenol capsules -- which were removed from the market on Oct. 5 -- began returning to store shelves with
tamper-resistant packaging on Dec. 7, and sales data are not yet available. But a recent survey indicates the
public has not lost its confidence in the product name.
Based on a sample of food stores in four cities, Information Resources of Chicago found that purchases of
Tylenol tablets, which fell below 7 percent of those for non-prescription analgesics after the capsules were
withdrawn, climbed to 21.3 percent during the week of Nov. 15, and rose to about 30 percent after the company
started a massive coupon-distribution program. (See chart.)
Before the poisonings, the survey showed Tylenol tablets with a 22 percent share of analgesic sales in food
stores, and the capsules with another 24.7 percent, for a total of 46.7 percent. (Food stores account for about 50
percent of analgesic sales, drug stores for 39 percent, and mass merchandisers and others about 11 percent,
according to an Information Resources official.)
Other studies had shown Tylenol products with a 37 percent market share in all types of stores before the
Chicago poisonings, exceeding the combined sales of Anacin, Bufferin, Bayer and Excedrin.
"The conventional wisdom failed to recognize that this wasn't a product-specific issue," says Richard Stover, an
analyst with Bache Halsey Stuart Shields. "The recent disclosure of a cyanide tampering case with Anacin-3 in
California reinforces my belief that safety in packaging is really the key element in the consumer's mind.
"As consumers have received more and more information, their concern has shifted from Tylenol to the integrity
of the packaging of most things. I think Tylenol will be No. 1 again by the end of January, and I think that by the
end of 1983, the product may have an even higher market share than it did before."
If Tylenol does regain its dominant position in the market, J&J officials will deserve much of the credit for their
response to the tragedy.

Group chairman Nelson, who recalls that the initial reaction to the crisis at J&J was shock, remarks that "this
organization has responded beautifully to the crisis."
McNeil built Tylenol into a major brand in the 1960s by promoting the non-aspirin product exclusively to doctors.
By 1972, the product had become the largest-selling pain reliever in the nation, without the aid of consumer
advertising. In 1975, McNeil began advertising Tylenol, and last year the product contributed 7 percent of
Johnson & Johnson's worldwide sales and almost 20 percent of its profits.
J&J first learned that Tylenol was somehow involved in several deaths in the Chicago area on Sept. 30, when the
company received a phone call from a journalist. After confirming the situation, the company voluntarily withdrew
all its capsules from Chicago.
On Oct. 5, after Tylenol capsules in California were found to contain poison, the company stopped distribution of
Tylenol capsules and recalled 31 million bottles already shipped. The company put the cost of the recall at $100
million.
Meanwhile, a crisis management team was set up, and met twice daily until recently. (It still meets periodically.)
A 24-hour toll-free hotline was set up to answer questions from the public and arrange the exchange of Tylenol
tablets for capsules. By last week the hotline had handled 290,000 calls.
The company sent mailgrams to retailers and medical professionals throughout the nation explaining the
situation, and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual or persons
responsible for the poisonings.
Nelson, a member of the crisis management team, said one critical decision by the company was to cooperate
fully with the press so that consumers and retailers would be alerted to the circumstances of the case as rapidly
as possible. According to research done for the company in the weeks following the poisonings, an astounding 94
percent of the public knew of the Tylenol tragedy, Nelson said.
J&J also cooperated with the Food and Drug Administration by undertaking an analysis of the 31 million recalled
Tylenol bottles. According to Nelson, "two or three bottles" returned from the Chicago area contained
cyanide-laced capsules.
During the crisis, company officials say, they debated the questions of whether to stop making Tylenol in capsule
form (and decided not to abandon it) and whether to add a new brand under another name (which has not yet
been ruled out).
One of the key elements in the company's future marketing plans is based on an Oct. 15 letter from the FDA
which concluded the contamination of the product took place either while the Tylenol was in transit or, most likely,
after it was placed on the retailers' shelves. This reinforced what J&J officials already believed: that there was no
tampering with the product while it was in their factories.
Even before the major producers of consumer drugs agreed to do so on Oct. 5, J&J launched a crash program to
develop tamper-resistant packaging. Nelson concedes that "there never was a single word around here about
tamper-resistant packaging before this tragedy."
In addition to launching a print campaign encouraging Tylenol capsule users to switch to tablets until the
capsules were available in the new packaging, the company spent $2.8 million on a prime-time TV ad campaign
in late October. In the commercials the company's medical director delivered a sober report and concluded with
the message, "We want you to continue to trust Tylenol."
In November, the company launched a massive program to restore the confidence of medical professionals in
Tylenol. More than 2,000 J&J representatives are taking part in this personal selling effort.
In an effort to get the product back on medicine cabinet shelves in homes, J&J distributed 40 million coupons
worth $2.50 toward the purchase of a Tylenol product. Distribution of another batch of coupons starts today
through 180 newspapers nationwide.
J&J will launch a new series of print ads in February and TV advertising will resume next month. While the final
decision on the approach of the TV ads has not been made, commercials being tested revolve around the theme,
"Tylenol -- you can trust our good name." The print ads will be used to explain the tamper-resistant packaging, a
topic which J&J officials believe is too difficult to explain in a brief TV commercial.

A. G. Becker analyst David F. Saks says McNeil's costs from the Tylenol tragedy would have bankrupted the
company if it weren't part of a larger corporation with the resources to try to rescue the product.
Saks had expected Tylenol sales this year to grow to $500 million, from $400 million in 1981. Since the
poisonings, he has lowered his 1982 estimate to $400 million, and predicts sales next year of $300 million.
"By committing more that $100 million to protect the Tylenol franchise on top of their lost sales of another $100
million in three months, the company has earned a lot of respect, especially since consumers aren't being asked
to pay for any of it," Saks says.
"One reason the consensus at the time of the poisoning was that J&J should keep quiet, act slowly, and possibly
come out with a new brand, was that advertising people didn't anticipate the humanistic and socially responsive
response J&J would make."

ANACIN MIGHT FACE PROBLEMS LIKE TYLENOL'S

ANACIN MIGHT FACE PROBLEMS LIKE TYLENOL'S

News reports that a woman in San Jose, Calif., may have been poisoned by swallowing Anacin III capsules laced
with cyanide raises a possibility that the American Home Products Company, which makes Anacin, might suffer
problems similar to those of the Johnson & Johnson Company, the manufacturer of Extra Strength Tylenol.
American Home, based in New York, said it had started an investigation into the incident, but added that it did not
expect to recall any Anacin III bottles from the market. Anacin III, which the company began selling in 1981, is a
non@-aspirin pain reliever almost identical in chemical composition to Extra Strength Tylenol. It is available as
both a tablet and a capsule, as is Tylenol, and it ranked second, behind Tylenol, in sales of analgesics before
late September, when cyanide contamination of Tylenol capsules caused seven deaths in the Chicago area.
Tylenol sales fell sharply as a result of the scare, and the capsules were withdrawn from the market. Johnson &
Johnson is now engaged in an expensive advertising campaign to re-establish the Tylenol brand. No Sign of
Tampering Found
Jack Wood, a spokesman for American Home, said of the Anacin report from California: ''There is nothing that
indicates this is anything other than an isolated incident limited to one drugstore.''
Mr. Wood said American Home had not yet examined capsules in the bottle from the home of the San Jose
woman, who became ill on Nov. 26 and is in the hospital in stable condition.
On Wall Street, trading in the stock of the Bristol-Myers Company, which produces Bufferin, Exedrin and other
nonprescription drugs that compete with Anacin, was halted at 2:35 P.M. in response to the news from California
and reopened at 3:05 P.M.
The New York Stock Exchange said in a statement that it had ordered the halt because of a ''surge of orders
caused by a news development.'' It did not explain why trading was halted in Bristol-Myers, which has nothing to
do with Anacin.
Trading in American Home shares was not interrupted. The stock closed at $42.625, down $2.875 for the day, in
heavy trading. Johnson & Johnson's stock seemed immune to the hubbub, closing at $48.125, down 12 1/2 cents.
David F. Saks, an analyst for the brokerage house of A.G. Becker Inc., said there was a ''clear analogy'' between
the problems American Home now faces and those of Johnson & Johnson. ''Anacin III has been the big winner in
the void created since the Tylenol scare,'' he said.
Anacin III is made in Elkhart, Ind., and Hammonton, N.J. They are operated by Whitehall Laboratories, a
subsidiary of American Home. Mr. Wood said the Anacin III bottle involved in the San Jose incident was shipped
there in October. The capsules it contained had been made and packaged at Elkhart.
American Home, a diversified company, makes a wide range of food items, drugs and household goods. Products
With Heavy Sales
Its packaged medicines division, which contributed 14 percent of the company's total sales of $4.13 billion last
year, makes Dristan decongestants, Preparation H hemorrhoid remedy and other nonprescription drugs in
addition to Anacin.

Mr. Wood said the Anacin III being di stributed in San Jose was not yet packaged in tamper-resistant bottles. In
November, in response to the nationwide alarm over the Chicago cyanide deaths, the Food and Drug
Administration issued rules requiring tamperproof packaging for most nonprescription products, including Anacin
III.

NEW YORK - THE MOST POINTED ADVERTISEMENT TO COME OUT IN THE WAKE OF THE
CYANIDE-TAINTED TYLENOL POISONINGS 10 WEEKS AGO BEGAN AIRING THIS WEEK.
THE AD, PROMOTING STERLING DRUG INC.'S BAYER ASPIRIN, FOCUSES ON TAMPER-RESISTANT
PACKAGING AND THE FACT THAT BAYER HAS USED IT FOR 25 YEARS. BY CONTRAST, JOHNSON &
JOHNSON, TYLENOL'S PARENT, ANNOUNCED THE PRODUCT'S FIRST TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGE
ONLY LAST MONTH.
DESIGNED BY THE AD AGENCY SSC&B INC. FOLLOWING SEVEN DEATHS IN THE CHICAGO AREA FROM
TYLENOL CAPSULES LACED WITH CYANIDE, THE BAYER AD USES AN APPROACH THAT IS STRIKINGLY
SIMILAR TO TYLENOL'S FIRST PUBLIC SERVICE-STYLED MESSAGE AFTER THE TRAGEDY.
THE TYLENOL AD, CONSIDERED BY MARKETERS TO BE A MODEL EXAMPLE OF HOW TO RESPOND TO
NEGATIVE NEWS EVENTS, FEATURES THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S MCNEIL
CONSUMER PRODUCTS CO. UNIT, WHERE TYLENOL IS PRODUCED, IN A LIBRARY-LIKE SETTING.
BAYER ASPIRIN'S TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING FEATURES A GLUE SEAL ON BOXES IN WHICH
BOTTLES OF TABLETS ARE SOLD. A BAYER SPOKESMAN SAID NO ADDITIONAL TAMPER-RESISTANT
MEASURES ARE PLANNED.
TYLENOL'S NEW TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING, SCHEDULED TO REACH STORE SHELVES THIS
MONTH, USES THREE METHODS. THE BOX WILL BE GLUED, THE BOTTLE WILL FEATURE A RED
PLASTIC WRAPPING THAT COVER THE CAP AND MOUTH, AND AN ADDITIONAL FOIL SEAL WILL COVER
THE BOTTLE'S OPENING.
THE NEW BAYER AD ALSO TARGETS CONSUMERS WHO VIEW CAPSULES AS EASIER TO SWALLOW
THAN TABLETS AND EMPHASIZES BAYER TABLETS' NEW SLICK COATING. JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS
WITHDRAWN ALL TYLENOL CAPSULES FROM THE MARKET SINCE THE POISONINGS.
DATA COMPILED BY INFORMATION RESOURCES INC., CHICAGO, SHOW THAT IN FOUR TEST MARKETS
BELIEVED TO REPRESENT A CROSS SECTION OF THE OVERALL AMERICAN MARKET, BAYER HAS
PICKED UP 14% OF THE BUSINESS TYLENOL HAS LOST SINCE THE POISONINGS, LESS THAN GAINS
MADE BY ANACIN, EXCEDRIN AND BUFFERIN. BAYER'S SHARE IN THE LOST MARKETS INCREASED TO
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 15% FROM 8.6% BEFORE THE POISONINGS.
ANACIN IS MADE BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP., WHILE EXCEDRIN IS MADE BY
BRISTOL-MYERS INC.
AT STERLING, A SPOKESMAN SAID THE NEW AD ISN'T A CHEAP SHOT. "THERE ARE FOUR OTHER
BRANDS OUT THERE WITH TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING IN THEIR ADS. WE HAD TO REASSURE
THE PUBLIC," HE SAID.
A JOHNSON & JOHNSON SPOKESMAN DECLINED COMMENT "ON WHAT A COMPETITOR DOES."

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Dec. 7 -- The first tamper-resistant packages of Tylenol capsules have been shipped to
120 supermarkets in the Northeast, according to a spokesman for the Supermarkets General chain.
After the deaths of seven people in the Chicago area were linked to cyanide-laced capsules of Extra-Strength
Tylenol in late September, Extra-Strength and Regular-Strength capsules were recalled by Johnson & Johnson.
The new packages of Extra-Strength Tylenol were sent Monday to 120 Pathmark stores of Supermarkets
General in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Delaware, the chain's spokesman, Robert
Wunderly, said today.
Officials at the McNeil Consumer Products Company, which makes the pain reliever, and at Johnson & Johnson,
the parent concern, which is based here, said they would know by Friday how consumers were responding.

THE CYANIDE-POISONING DEATHS THAT TOPPLED JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S TYLENOL FROM ITS NO. 1
POSITION TWO MONTHS AGO HAVE BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO STRUGGLING COMPETITORS.
TYLENOL'S MISFORTUNES ALSO HAVE HELPED PUSH AT LEAST ONE NEW ENTRY INTO THE
BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS OF PAIN RELIEF, AND THEY HAVE SPURRED SOME CHANGES IN HOW THE
BRANDS ARE MARKETED.
ANALGESIC PRODUCTS THAT NEVER BEFORE EMPHASIZED THEIR INGREDIENTS--SUCH AS
EXCEDRIN P.M., PAMPRIN AND ARTHRITIS PAIN FORMULA--NOW HEAVILY STRESS THAT THEY ARE
"100% ASPIRIN-FREE." THAT PITCH IS AIMED AT TYLENOL USERS, TWO-THIRDS OF WHOM WERE
ADVISED BY THEIR DOCTORS TO SWITCH TO ACETAMINOPHEN BRANDS SUCH AS PERCOGESIC, WHO
HAD SHUNNED MASS-MARKETING EFFORTS, ARE STARTING NATIONAL RADIO AND COUPON
CAMPAIGNS.
"OBVIOUSLY THE CATEGORY IS IN A STATE OF FLUX," SAYS GEORGE MOMANEY, VICE PRESIDENT
WITH THE DISTRIBUTION UNIT OF THE NATION'S LARGEST DRUG WHOLESALER,
FOREMOST-MCKESSON INC. "TYLENOL'S SHARE WAS SO HUGE THAT CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO BE
BUYING SOME TYPE OF HEADACHE REMEDY."
THE BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY IS WHETHER OTHER BRANDS CAN PERMANENTLY CONVERT WARY
TYLENOL USERS. A GROWING NUMBER OF MARKETERS, IMPRESSED BY THE SWIFT REACTION OF
JOHNSON & JOHNSON, ARE DOUBTFUL. SOME 210,000 CONSUMERS HAVE USED TYLENOL'S
TOLL-FREE PHONE LINE TO ORDER FREE REPLACEMENTS; AN UNPRECEDENTED 40 MILLION $2.50
DISCOUNT COUPONS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED; AND A SALES FORCE BOOSTED TO 2,200 FROM 250
WILL VISIT 900,000 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
BUT THE TYLENOL TRAGEDY HAS INFUSED A NEW SENSE OF RISK AND COMPETITION INTO THE
PAIN-RELIEVER BUSINESS. FOR SEVERAL YEARS, HIGHER-PRICED TYLENOL HAD OUTSOLD THE
COMBINED SALES OF ANACIN, EXCEDRIN, BAYER AND BUFFERIN; NOW SALES OF THOSE FOUR
ASPIRIN BRANDS ARE UP 25% TO 50% EACH, ACCORDING TO FOREMOST-MCKESSON INC.
THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY THOSE SALES GAINS ARE ONLY TEMPORARY. TYLENOL'S
CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE CHOSEN A WELL-KNOWN ASPIRIN BRAND ONLY UNTIL THE FULL TYLENOL
LINE IS BACK. INFORMATION RESOURCES INC., A CHICAGO COMPANY TRACKING SALES IN FOUR
IMPORTANT TEST MARKETS, SAYS ASPIRIN BRANDS RATHER THAN ACETAMINOPHEN COMPETITORS
HAVE ABSORBED 80% OF TYLENOL'S LOST SALES.
NOW TYLENOL'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE COMES FROM ANACIN-3 AND DATRIL, THE ONLY OTHER
FAIRLY FAMILIAR BRANDS OF ACETAMINOPHEN. SALES OF BOTH ARE RUNNING FOUR TO FIVE TIMES
HIGHER THAN USUAL, SAYS FOREMOST-MCKESSON. AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP., WHICH
MAKES ANACIN-3, AND BRISTOL-MYERS HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR A NEW MARKETING PUSH.
AFTER THE DEATHS OF SEVEN CHICAGO-AREA RESIDENTS WHO SWALLOWED CYANIDE-LACED
CAPSULES OF EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL, COMPETITORS WERE CAREFUL TO AVOID EXPLOITING
THE BRAND'S FIRST WEAKNESS. THAT AGREEMENT SEEMS TO HAVE LAPSED. DATRIL'S PRINT ADS
TACITLY ALLUDE TO RECENT EVENTS. BAYER ASPIRIN OUTLINES LIVER-DAMAGE DANGERS FROM
OVERDOSES OF TYLENOL'S SOLE INGREDIENT.

SUCH AGGRESSIVENESS, COUPLED WITH THE ANACIN NAME, HAS PAID OFF. ANACIN-3 HAS CLAIMED
15% OF TYLENOL'S LOST BUSINESS, WHILE DATRIL AND OTHER ACETAMINOPEN BRANDS COMBINED
HAVE TAKEN ONLY 5%, ACCORDING TO INFORMATION RESOURCES.

THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG THAT LEAD WILL LAST. THE MAKERS OF TYLENOL WERE FIRST TO
ANNOUNCE--IN A NATIONALLY REPORTED PRESS CONFERENCE RATHER THAN A TV AD--NEW
TRIPLE-LAYER TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING. THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DATRIL AND
ANACIN-3 TO TRADE ON SAFETY. MOREOVER, BOTH ANACIN-3 AND DATRIL LACK THE YEARS OF
PHYSICIAN RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE INSTRUMENTAL TO TYLENOL'S SUCCESS. ONE
ACETAMINOPHEN COMPETITOR, PERCOGESIC, A PRODUCT OF RICHARDSON VICKS INC., DOES HAVE
A HERITAGE OF SO-CALLED ETHICAL MARKETING TO DOCTORS AND PHARMACISTS SIMILAR TO THAT
OF TYLENOL. BUT THE CYANIDE POISONINGS ACTUALLY MAY HAVE WORKED TO PERCOGESIC'S
DISADVANTAGE BY PROMPTING STRONGER COMPETITORS TO INTENSIFY MARKETING EFFORTS
BEFORE A NEW PERCOGESIC CAMPAIGN COULD TAKE OFF. A SPOKESMAN SAYS JANUARY 1983 ADS
ARE LIMITED TO RADIO AND NEWSPAPERS FOR NOW.
TYLENOL ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM A NEW BRAND OR TWO. BAYER ASPIRIN'S STERLING
DRUG INC., WHICH FAILED IN 1976 TO MARKET BAYER NON-ASPIRIN, IS CONSIDERING INTRODUCING
PANADOL, ITS TOP-SELLING EXTRA-STRENGTH ACETAMINOPHEN BRAND SOLD IN THE UNITED

SEPTEMBER. A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE MAKER, SCHERING-PLOUGH CORP., DECLINED TO SAY
WHETHER THE GO-AHEAD DECISION WAS MADE AFTER THE POISONINGS. THE BRAND CARRIES TWO
DRAWBACKS: IT WILL COME IN ONLY ONE SIZE--PACKAGES OF 40 TABLETS--AND IT WON'T INITIALLY
BE OFFERED IN CAPSULE FORM.
GENERIC AND STORE-BRAND LABELS OF ACETAMINOPHEN POSE EVEN LESS OF A THREAT TO
TYLENOL'S COMEBACK DRIVE, DESPITE THOSE PRODUCTS' STRONG SALES GAINS IN THE TWO

JOHNSON &JOHNSON, the US drugs manufacture, hopes that when it puts its Tylenol pain killing drug back on
sale, the event will mark the end of an horrific episode. It began when seven Chicago purchasers of Tylenol died
after an unknown hand introduced cyanide into the capsules, which were sold widely throughout the US
The tragedy has already had far-reaching implications for business in the US and, according to at least one
analyst of the packaging industry, it ought to be attracting more attention in Europe.
Next month, Johnson &Johnson will resume sales of Tylenol - it was quick to take the drug off the shelves when
the poisonings became known last September. The capsules will now be sold in a 'triple-sealed, tamper-resistent
package.'
The purpose of the new packaging is, first, to repel attempts to tamper with the container while it lies on the
retailer's shelf, and, second, to make any such attempt obvious to customers.
The safety features incorporated in the new Tylenol packaging are not, in fact, new at all. They comprise glued
down flaps on the cardboard box holding the bottle, a plastic seal around the bottle's neck, and an inner foil seal
over the bottle's mouth.
The neck seal is widely used, paradoxically enough, in the liquor trade, while the foil seal is similar to those used
in packaging fresh coffee.
But the rapid application of such products is not confined to Johnson &Johnson: it has occurred throughout the
US pharmaceuticals industry and reflects the concern shown by consumer and manufacturer alike in the wake of
last September's poisonings.
The pharmaceuticals industry, headed by Johnson &Johnson, was quick to respond to the situation. The
Pharmaceuticals Association, which represents the major manufacturers, has already agreed with the Food and
Drugs Administration on guidelines for safety standards.
The potential market for safe, tamper-proof containers for pharmaceuticals has been largely ignored in the past
by the leading can and packaging companies, which have preferred to concentrate on the mass beer and soft
drink markets. Consequently, demand for the products can be met only by a host of relatively small and little
known US companies - Dougherty Brothers, West Company, and Paco Pharmaceutical Services.
But demand for safety containers there certainly is: sales of some non-prescription drugs fell by as much as 40
per cent in the days immediately following the Tylenol panic. Such falls have subsequently been largely made up,
but fourth quarter earnings from the industry are likely to show the effects.
Johnson &Johnson wrote off Dollars 100m pre-tax against third quarter earnings in respect of the affair and will,
over the next two months, issue 40m free coupons worth Dollars 2.50 towards the purchase of any Tylenol
product, in a move to recompense customers for the uncountable number of Tylenol capsules which they threw
away at the height of the drama.
Against figures like this, the cost of the new safety containers is a tiny 2.4 cents a package - a charge which the
company will take on board.

Mr Edward Schollmeyer, packaging industry analyst with Paine, Webber, Mitchell Hutchins, commented that at
the recent packaging industry exhibition in Chicago, 'nearly everyone was offering some kind of safety packaging.'
But in a tour of the European industry last week, he found a surprising lack of awareness of this latest
development.
The opportunities for the smaller manufacturer to supply safety packaging are considerable, he pointed out.

CHICAGO, Nov. 24 -- Mayor Jane M. Byrne today lifted the ban on the sale of all Tylenol products that she
imposed citywide after seven persons in the Chicago area died two months ago from cyanidefilled capsules of the
pain remedy. At a news conference, the Mayor said that new triple-sealed bottles of Tylenol would be on store
shelves in about two weeks. The pills, manufactured by the McNeil Consumer Products Company, are protected
by a glue flap on the box, a red plastic wrap around the bottle's neck and foil across the top of the bottle.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Nov. 21 -- Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules will be back on some store shelves by the
end of the week in tamperresistant packaging, and Johnson & Johnson is hoping to lure back customers with 80
million coupons worth $2.50 each. All Tylenol capsules were withdrawn from the market in late September after
seven persons in the Chicago area died after taking capsules poisoned with cyanide. No arrests have been
made.

Resurrection of Tylenol Begun

Johnson & Johnson has embarked on a million-dollar gamble to resurrect Tylenol as one of America's top
money-making drugs, an action company Chairman James E. Burke called "a moral imperative as well as good
business."
The company will run the first of a series of advertisements in Sunday newspapers containing a coupon worth
$2.50 toward the purchase of any kind of Tylenol, one of Johnson & Johnson's most profitable products until
seven people in Chicago died from cyanide-tainted Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules.
The company has been absolved of any blame in the poisonings and won national acclaim for its forthright
handling of the episode. In the process, however, Tylenol plummeted from its commanding position holding a full
37 percent of the nation's billion-dollar painkiller market to its present place, estimated by some Wall Street
analysts at a lowly 7 percent.
Although Johnson & Johnson is being extremely close-mouthed about its total strategy to rejuvenate Tylenol, the
coupons in the newspaper ads appear to be a major element, aimed largely at luring old customers back into the
fold. The advertisement will be run the following Sunday in different parts of the country and both ads will be
repeated in December.
The results of a companion campaign asking former users to telephone Johnson & Johnson for the $2.50 coupon
has generated some optimism in the company's New Brunswick, N.J., headquarters. The 24-hour, 800-number
phone line drew 110,000 calls during its first week of operation.
Furthermore, a company survey shows that a growing number of former users -- 88 percent at the last count, up
11 percentage points in less than two weeks -- expressed a willingness to repurchase Tylenol if the capsules
were contained in tamper-resistant packages.
Johnson & Johnson will be the first drug company to have its products on the shelves in the new type of
packaging now mandated by the federal government. Some Tylenol packages already are in the distribution
chain and are expected to reach the large chain stores first, then spread across the country by early January,
when the company will start a massive television advertising campaign.
It already is distributing samples of Tylenol tablets to doctors to give to their patients -- a mainstay of the original
marketing plan -- and once the capsules are in stores, Johnson & Johnson will begin distributing samples of them.
The sampling is likely to involve more than 50 million capsules and is aimed at getting health professionals to lure
patients back to Tylenol.
One especially knowledgable Wall Street analyst, Larry N. Feinberg of Dean Witter Reynolds, believes Tylenol
will not regain any major share of the market until its credibility is re-established with doctors and pharmacists,
who referred close to 80 percent of users to the product in the first place. He said sales of Tylenol, the fourth
most-prescribed drug in the country last year, dropped 30 percent in October, indicating a falloff in professional
confidence.
He estimated it will take until 1985 for Tylenol to reach the $435 million in sales expected this year if the Chicago
deaths hadn't severely cut last-quarter sales, which Feinberg said would fall to $30 million from the $115 million
he originally had projected.

No one will say how much the campaign will cost. Johnson & Johnson already has spent $100 million withdrawing
and destroying capsules and expects to pay between $40 million and $80 million on the coupon and telephone
campaigns. That's just the beginning, but Johnson & Johnson declined yesterday to estimate the anticipated
costs of future promotions and advertising.
Boosted by a textbook-perfect marketing campaign seven years ago, Tylenol had been a major money-maker for
Johnson & Johnson. Feinberg estimated it alone was responsible for nearly 19 percent of corporate profits during
the first three-fourths of the year, before the poisonings. Furthermore, Feinberg said, Tylenol accounted for 13
percent of Johnson & Johnson's year-to-year sales growth and "a whopping" 33 percent of the company's
year-to-year profit growth.
"If Tylenol were a separate company, its profits before this incident would place it in the top half of the Fortune
500 list of companies," Burke said.
American Home Product's Anacin 3 and Bristol Myers' Datril, essentially the same chemical formulation as
Tylenol, are expected to intensify their advertising campaigns.

Advertising; Pointing Way For Tylenol

CONSUMER advertising may have only limited effectiveness in Johnson & Johnson's campaign to revive Tylenol
sales, Larry N. Feinberg of the Wall Street house of Dean Witter Reynolds suggested the other day.
As a stock market analyst, Mr. Feinberg brings special expertise to his musings on the ways Madison Avenue
may, or may not, get Tylenol moving off the nation's drugstore shelves again.
Mr. Feinberg, who has studied biochemistry, wrote a nine-page report on Johnson & Johnson (''The Tylenol
Affair: One Month Later'') a few days ago.
But Mr. Feinberg's also has first-hand experience with the industry. His family owns a chain of pharmacies in
Vermont, and he spent seven years in the business, including three as the manager of a drugstore in Middlebury.
With that perspective, there was one statistic that he found striking among all the market data about Tylenol:
Almost 80 percent of the product's users had originally been referred to it by a doctor or pharmacist.
After poisoned Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules killed seven people this fall, Tylenol's share of the
over-the-counter pain-reliever market shrank to roughly 7 percent from 37 percent earlier in the year, and it is only
''slowly creeping back,'' Mr. Feinberg suggested,
Tylenol capsules were pulled off the retail market but are to reappear within weeks. The company said last
Thursday that it was sticking with the Tylenol brand name, has introduced new tamperresistant packaging for
Tylenol capsules and has begun a push to raise sales through couponing and other activities.
New consumer advertising, from the Compton agency, is being tested. F. Robert Kniffin, Johnson & Johnson's
director of public relations, said yesterday from the company's headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., that
alternative advertising materials were still being considered, and that no decision had been made yet as to when
the new campaign would begin.
And James E. Burke, Johnson & Johnson's chairman, said in Chicago yesterday that the company was not going
to strive for new customers, but would ''try to get our regular customers back.''
For his part, Mr. Feinberg said in an interview that, given all the anxiety generated by the deaths, consumers are
still ''trying to work out their fears into a purchase decision, and they're looking for help, and I think the health care
professionals will have as big a role in the consumers' decisions in the future as they did in the past - or a bigger
one.''
But Stanley M. Zdep, a psychologist on the staff of Audits and Surveys Inc., a market research organization that
recently carried out an independent survey of consumer attitudes toward Tylenol, disagreed. He reported that 52
percent of the consumers in his survey said they had used Tylenol at one time or another, and he said: ''I
wouldn't think they would need a reintroduction to the product by their physicians'' or pharmacists.
Mr. Feinberg had praise for the large-scale consumer coupon campaign that Johnson & Johnson announced last
week. ''The coupon campaign is a sound marketing move,'' he said, ''It will stimulate initial sales. Obviously
they're trying to get the product into the hands of the consumer as quickly as possible.''

Page 84 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

The new advertising, he went on, ''will have to emphasize the new safety features of the product, and I'm sure it
will. But not only do they have to re-educate the consumer, they have to re-establish the product with health care
professionals - and that's where the real stumbling block could be.''
Mr. Feinberg said essentially what the company should do was to incur ''heavy promotion expenditures toward
the professions'' including mailings and grass-roots visits by company representatives, along with generous
giving-out of free samples. Johnson & Johnson has already gone the mailing route and has deployed thousands
of salesmen to buttonhole health care professionals.
Yet even those exertions will have only limited utility, Mr. Feinberg suggested, in helping Tylenol compete against
rival products that are made out of the same popular, non-aspirin ingreient, acetaminophen.
As he wrote in his report, ''Many less expensive brands of acetaminophen are becoming more heavily promoted
now that the seemingly impenetrable wall surrounding the Tylenol image has been shattered, and competitive
pricing is expected to become a major factor in these markets in the future.''

NEW YORK--JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN TO GET TYLENOL BOTTLES BACK IN AMERICAN
MEDICINE CHESTS IS ANOTHER BOLD GAMBLE FOR A COMPANY THAT SEEMS TO THRIVE ON THEM.
FACED WITH THE NEAR-COLLAPSE OF THE BRAND AFTER TYLENOL CAPSULES LACED WITH CYANIDE
KILLED SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE CHICAGO AREA SIX WEEKS AGO, JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS DECIDED
TO FIGHT BACK BY OFFERING TO REPLACE TYLENOL THAT FRIGHTENED CONSUMERS MIGHT HAVE
THROWN OUT, AND TO, IN EFFECT, GIVE AWAY AS MANY OF 80 MILLION BOTTLES THROUGH COUPON
OFFERS.
"IT'S BECOME CLEAR TO US THAT OUR MOST INPORTANT JOB IS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE" IN THE
BRAND, SAYS DAVID E. COLLINS, CHAIRMAN OF MCNEIL CONSUMER PRODUCTS CO., THE JOHNSON &
JOHNSON UNIT THAT MARKETS TYLENOL. "IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAD TO GET IT BACK IN OUR
CUSTOMERS' HOMES."
THIS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM, WHICH SOME MARKETING SOURCES SAY MAY COST JOHNSON &
JOHNSON $30 MILLION OR MORE, IS THE HEART OF A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN THAT ALSO FEATURES
NEW TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING FOR TYLENOL CAPSULES AND A SALES BLITZ OF THE
MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND PHARMACISTS.
SOME SAY THE FREE OFFER, WHICH WILL BE PROMOTED THROUGH THE PLACEMENT OF 40 MILLION
$2.50 COUPONS IN NEWSPAPER ADS NEXT SUNDAY AND THE MONDAY AFTER, AND AN ADDITIONAL
40 MILLION COUPONS ON DEC. 19, MAY RECEIVE A POOR RESPONSE.
IN FACT, JOHNSON & JOHNSON OFFICIALS CONCEDE THAT AN OFFER TO REPLACE CAPSULE
PRODUCTS WITH TABLETS EARLY IN THE CRISIS WASN'T WELL SUBSCRIBED TO, THOUGH THEY SAY
THAT OFFER WASN'T ADVERTISED WIDELY. NONETHELESS, CRITICS ARGUE THAT IF THE CURRENT
OFFER ISN'T A RESOUNDING SUCCESS, THE COMPANY WILL BE HARD-PRESSED TO COME UP WITH A
FOLLOW-UP CAMPAIGN.
OTHERS SAY THAT BY RETURNING CAPSULES TO STORE SHELVES SO SOON, THE COMPANY RUNS
THE RISK OF OFFENDING CONSUMERS, OR OF EVEN BEING VULNERABLE TO ANOTHER ATTACK.
HOWEVER, AS IT HAS SAID FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS, JOHNSON & JOHNSON MAINTAINS ITS OWN
CONSUMER POLLS INDICATE THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. "OUR INFORMATION IS THAT 35% OF
TYLENOL USERS THREW AWAY THE PRODUCT," SAYS COLLINS. "THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO USED
TYLENOL, PURCHASED IT, ALREADY LIKED IT."
COLLINS SAYS THE COMPANY DECIDED TO USE THE COUPON TACTIC TO REGAIN OLD CUSTOMERS
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO AFTER DISCOVERING HOW PEOPLE HAD THROWN THE PRODUCT OUT.
COLLINS SAYS THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WILL GET A STRONG RESPONSE FROM THE COUPON
BECAUSE OF ITS UNUSUALLY LARGE VALUE, AND BECAUSE IT CAN BE REDEEMED OVER THE
COURSE OF A YEAR.
HE ALSO SAYS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A FUTURE CONTAMINATION IS A CONCERN "WE CAN'T
BE RULED BY. I THINK AMERICANS HAVE COME TO ACCEPT PRODUCT TAMPERING AS A NEW
DANGER."

Tylenol Is Reintroduced In Triple-Sealed Package

Johnson & Johnson Co., the maker of Tylenol, announced yesterday that Tylenol capsules will be immediately
reintroduced into the market in a new triple-sealed package, and the company will replace any bottle thrown out
by customers after the seven cyanide deaths in Chicago.
In a move to try to regain its leading position among over-the-counter pain relievers, Johnson & Johnson became
the first company to reenter the market with the package protection required by the new Food and Drug
Administration rule approved last week.
James E. Burke, chairman of Johnson & Johnson, said salesmen are already selling the newly packaged product,
which he said has three separate seals against tampering: glued down box tops, a plastic neck around the cap of
the bottle, and a tough foil seal under the cap.
The recall and destruction of some 31 million bottles of Tylenol that has occurred so far, plus the replacement of
bottles, will cost over $100 million, Burke said. None of this cost, or the cost of putting the new package on
Tylenol, will be passed on to the customer, Burke said.
"I think it is a cost we should absorb, but as a matter of fact I don't think the consumer would pay for it," he said.
Except for a brief television campaign in late October asking the public to "trust" Tylenol, all ads for the product
were withdrawn after the deaths, which are still under investigation. Burke said that apart from the ads offering
coupons to replace thrown-away Tylenol, no other advertising is now scheduled.
"We consider it a moral imperative as well as good business to restore Tylenol to its preeminent position in the
marketplace," Burke told a news conference yesterday.
He urged the American public to "demonstrate a united determination not to allow our lives to be ruled by acts of
terrorism, not to allow America to be poisoned the way these seven people were poisoned."
In answer to a question about making a "moral decision" to absorb the cost of the tragedy and the repackaging,
Burke said, "Everything we have done, we did because it was good business."
Burke said it would be difficult to regain the full 37 percent share of the market Tylenol had before the tragedy. In
four cities where Tylenol had a 46 percent share of the over-the-counter analgesic market, he said, the share
dropped to 6.5 percent in only a few weeks. But now, it has recovered to 18 percent and is still rising.
He also said that after the first week of the tragedy, 40 percent of regular Tylenol users said they would continue
to buy the product. Five weeks later, that willingness had risen to 59 percent. And if tamper-resistant packaging
were added, some 77 percent of the regular Tylenol customers said they might return to buying the product.
He said that polls commissioned by the company showed that 90 percent of the people questioned do not hold
the manufacturer responsible for the deaths in Chicago.
After the Chicago poisonings, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, McNeil Consumer Products, recalled nationally
two batches of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules, and finally stopped production of the capsules.
Some 8 million capsules were tested for cyanide. Eight tainted bottles, with 75 contaminated capsules, were
found, all in Chicago. Hundreds of millions of returned capsules were incinerated by McNeil beginning this week.

Tylenol capsules will reappear on shelves in the new tamper-resistant package within the next few weeks in
many areas, and be distributed to 70 percent of the nationwide market by the first of the year, Burke said.

Johnson & Johnson announced yesterday that it would resume retail sales of Tylenol capsules within a few
weeks, this time in triplesealed, tamper-resistant packaging. The product is to reappear in most stores by Jan.1.
The company also announced an offer to replace, free and without asking for proof, the Tylenol capsules that
anxious consumers threw away as a result of the poison scare. And it said it would publish, in newspaper
advertisements in November and December, coupons worth $2.50 toward the purchase of any Tylenol product. A
bottle of 24 or 30 Tylenol capsules or tablets, either Extra-Strength or regular, generally sells for $2.50 or less.
David R. Chase, a Johnson & Johnson vice president, said 40 million coupons would be published as part of the
campaign to rebuild the market for Tylenol.
Johnson & Johnson's chairman, James E. Burke, said the addition of the new packaging features would increase
manufacturing costs by 2.4 cents a package - which the company plans to absorb, he said.
Speaking from New York in an unusual, satellite-linked video news conference that permitted exchanges with
reporters in 30 American cities, Mr. Burke said the impact on Johnson & Johnson's profits of absorbing the
additional packaging costs would depend on sales.
''The key to that will be what our volume will be - something we don't know,'' he said. He asserted that the lacing
of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules with cyanide in the Chicago area was a ''terrorist act,'' and he said Johnson &
Johnson considered it ''a moral imperative, as well as good business, to restore Tylenol to its preeminent position
in the market place.''
Asked about possible reaction in the investment community to the company's plan to absorb the new packaging
costs, he answered: ''I really believe most of our shareholders are with us for the long term.''
Johnson & Johnson stock rose $1.50 yesterday, to $47.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In a
prepared statement, Mr. Burke noted that Johnson & Johnson had already incurred costs of about $100 million in
issuing an initial warning after the capsule poisonings became known in late September and in recalling, testing
and destroying 22 million bottles of Tylenol capsules - both Extra-Strength and regular - that had been distributed
in the former packaging, which was not tamperresistant.
Earlier, Johnson & Johnson announced that the $100 million beforetax cost had been written off as a $50 million
after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings. The company did not offer an estimate yesterday of the costs of
the coupon and replacement programs. Rebuilding the Name
But Mr. Burke declared, speaking solemnly and deliberately from a rostrum in a hotel meeting room: ''We have
made the unequivocal commitment to rebuild this business under the Tylenol name. It will take time. It will take
money. And it will be very difficult. But we are confident that it can and should be done.''
Analysts and marketing specialists have been less sanguine about Tylenol's prospects. H. Edward Schollmeyer,
packaging analyst at Paine, Webber, Mitchell Hutchins Inc., said yesterday in a report to investors that the new
Tylenol packaging would be a major step in generating consumer confidence in the product.'' Some advertising
industry executives have said that repairing Tylenol's image will be a difficult task.
In response to a question, Mr. Burke said Johnson & Johnson did not know the present market share of the tablet
and liquid form Tylenol still on the market, ''but we suspect it's very low.'' He said Tylenol, in all its forms, had
Page 94 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

about 35 percent of the over-thecounter pain-reliever market before the cyanide poisoning resulted in seven
deaths in the Chicago area. The Federal Government has held that Johnson & Johnson was not to blame.
Larry N. Feinberg, a health-care analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, speculating on the basis of preliminary data,
said last week that Tylenol's market share might have shrunk to 7 percent of the painreliever market, which
totaled about $1 billion last year.
To make it easier for consumers to detect tampering in the future, Mr. Burke said, Tylenol capsule packages will
have three new safety features.
The outer box will have flaps that are glued shut and must be torn open before the bottle is touched. The bottle's
cap and neck will be covered with a tight plastic seal that must be torn, too, before the cap can be removed. And
the bottle's mouth will have over it a foil inner seal that must be broken before the capsules can be touched.
As an additional precaution, the bottle is to be labeled: ''Do not use if safety seals are broken.'' Before the Tylenol
poisonings, Tylenol capsules were packaged in bottles that were essentially similar - but they had caps that could
be opened easily and then closed, leaving no indication that they had been tampered with. And they had no
additional sealing feature, except some cotton inside the bottle. Similarly, in the former packaging, the outer box
could be opened and then closed again without leaving any sign that it had been interfered with.
After the Illinois tampering became known, Mr. Burke said, ''over one-third of our Tylenol users threw away the
Tylenol capsules they had out of fear generated during the early days of the tragedy.''
To obtain replacements of the capsules they discarded, he said, consumers anywhere in the country can
telephone a special toll-free telephone number, 1-800-232-2222, which began operating yesterday. Efforts to call
the number late yesterday afternoon were unsuccessful. It was busy.
Johnson & Johnson took all Tylenol capsules off the market after the Illinois deaths, which resulted from the
poisoning of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules. But the company continued to market Tylenol tablets and other
Tylenol products.
Yesterday, salesmen of the McNeil Consumer Products Company, the Johnson & Johnson unit that makes
Tylenol, began taking wholesale and retail orders for capsules in the new packaging, the company reported.
Mr. Burke said market research showed that 77 percent of Tylenol customers would buy Tylenol in a
tamper-resistant package.

NEW YORK - JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAID IT WILL UNVEIL SOME OF ITS MARKETING PLANS FOR
TYLENOL, INCLUDING A NEW TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING, AT A SPECIAL NEWS BRIEFING TO BE
BROADCAST TO REPORTERS IN 30 CITIES NATIONWIDE.
THE CLOSED-CIRCUIT VIDEO CONFERENCE IS PART OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S EFFORT TO REBUILD
TYLENOL'S IMAGE FOLLOWING THE DEATHS SIX WEEKS AGO OF SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE CHICAGO
AREA FROM CYANIDE-TAINTED EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL CAPSULES.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAID IT DECIDED TO BROADCAST THE NEWS BRIEFING, WHICH WILL
ORIGINATE FROM THE SHERATON CENTRE HOTEL IN NEW YORK, BECAUSE SO MANY REPORTERS
HAVE INQUIRED ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PLANS FOR THE PAIN RELIEVER.

THE CYANIDE-SPIKED TYLENOL CAPSULES THAT KILLED SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE CHICAGO AREA ARE
CONTINUING TO SPREAD POISONOUS EFFECTS THROUGH THE AMERICAN MARKETPLACE.
THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS APPREHENSIVE NOW. "WE BELIEVE THE BACKLASH IN PHARMACEUTICALS
WILL EVENTUALLY BE FELT IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY," SAYS JAMES MCCORD, A PACKAGING-FILM
OFFICIAL AT HERCULES INC.
HERCULES HAS BEEN URGING DRUG COMPANIES TO WRAP THEIR PRODUCTS IN ITS
POLYPROPYLENE FILM. HOWEVER, DRUG MAKERS SUCH AS STERLING DRUG INC., PFIZER INC. AND
BRISTOL-MYERS CO. SAY THEY ARE STUDYING TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING. THE FOOD AND
DRUG ADMINISTRAT ION ANNOUNCED ITS NEW DRUG-PACKAGING REQ UIREMENTS THURSDAY.
W. ROBERT LAYNE, A BUYER FOR THE WELLBY SUPER DRUG STORES UNIT OF HANNAFORD BROS.
CO., NOTES THAT CONSUMERS ARE "QUESTIONING THINGS LIKE THE EDGE OF A CAPSULE BEING
CRUSHED. ..IF IT'S EVEN SLIGHTLY DEFECTIVE, THEY'RE BRINGING IT BACK."
RETAILERS ARE BECOMING CAUTIOUS, TOO. WHEN A PACKAGE IS RETURNED BECAUSE IT LOOKS AS
IF IT "POSSIBLY HAS BEEN OPENED, " A SPOKESWOMAN FOR STOP & SHOP COS. SAYS, THE STORE
REMOVES ALL OF THAT BRAND FROM ITS SHELVES AND EXAMINES THE CONTAINERS. THE CHAIN
HAS STEPPED UP SURVEILLANCE OF STORES BY PLAINCLOTHES OBSERVERS.
SOME STORES HAVE BEEN HARASSED BY PRANK REPORTS OF PRODUCT TAMPERING. FOR
EXAMPLE, SOME CUSTOMERS WHO COMPLAINED OF FINDING RAZOR BLADES IN BALL PARK HOT
DOGS PRODUCED BY HYGRADE FOOD PRODUCTS CORP. LATER ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD PLANTED
THE BLADES.
MOST OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY HAS HAD FEW PROBLEMS WITH TAMPERING. IN SOUTHFIELD, MICH.,
JOEL DORFMAN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF FREDERICK & HERRUD INC., SAYS THE
MEATPACKER HASN'T NOTICED ANY CHANGES IN CONSUMER BUYING PATTERNS. HE NOTED THAT
THE COMPANY USED METAL DETECTORS TO CHECK PRODUCTS SUCH AS SAUSAGES AND SHIPS
OUT PRODUCTS IN VACUUM-SEALED PLASTIC PACKAGES THAT ARE "VIRTUALLY TAMPER-PROOF."
BUT HALLOWEEN CANDY SALES WERE POOR THIS YEAR. WALGREEN CO. SAYS THAT IN THE PEAK
HALLOWEEN BUYING PERIOD, ITS SALES OF CANDY IN BAGS FELL 20% FROM A YEAR EARLIER. A
SIMILAR DECLINE IS REPORTED BY PATHMARK SUPERMARKETS, OWNED BY SUPERMARKETS
GENERAL CORP. AN OFFICIAL AT KROGER CO. SUGGESTS THAT ITS POOR SALES OF CANDY WERE
ATTRIBUTABLE BOTH TO FEARS OF TAMPERING AND TO EXPECTATIONS OF LESS-THAN-NORMAL
TRICK-OR-TREAT TRAFFIC THIS YEAR.
THE BIGGEST SWITCH IN SALES, HOWEVER, IS IN THE TYLENOL CAPSULES THEMSELVES. THE
ONCE-POPULAR JOHNSON & JOHNSON PRODUCT HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM SALE. THE JEWEL
FOOD STORES UNIT OF JEWEL COS. SAYS SALES OF ALL BRANDS OF ANALGESIC CAPSULES ARE
"WAY DOWN" AT ITS STORES, AND GEORGE MOMANEY, A VICE PRESIDENT AT
FOREMOST-MCKESSON INC.'S DRUG UNIT, SAYS SALES OF ALL PAIN-RELIEF CAPSULES ARE DOWN
"AT LEAST BY HALF. "
SALES OF TYLENOL TABLETS ARE GENERALLY DOWN, TOO. PERRY DRUG STORES INC. PUTS THE
DROP AT 10%. SOUTHLAND CORP., WHICH OPERATES AND FRANCHISES 7-ELEVEN STORES, ALSO
NOTES A "SIGNIFICANT INCREASE" IN SALES OF OTHER PAINKILLER TABLETS.

MICKEY CLERC, DIRECTOR OF ADVERTISING FOR WINN-DIXIE STORES INC. IN JACKSONVILLE, FLA.,
SAYS, "I THINK THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH IN THE PRESS THAT EVERYONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT
EVERYTHING. STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE SWAMPED." THIS SORT OF
"OVERREACTION," SAYS A SPOKESMAN FOR LUCKY STORES INC. IN DUBLIN, CALIF., IS PARTLY THE
FAULT OF THE NEWS MEDIA.

THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION IS EXPECTED THIS WEEK OR NEXT TO DROP THE OTHER
SHOE IN THE TYLENOL TRAGEDY BY ANNOUNCING NEW PACKAGING REGULATIONS. THE POTENTIAL
SURGE IN BUSINESS FOR A HANDFUL OF PUBLICLY HELD PACKAGING AND PHARMACEUTICAL
SUPPLY COMPANIES HAS LIFTED THE STOCK PRICES OF A HANDFUL OF CONCERNS THOUGHT TO BE
POISED FOR A BIG PICKUP IN BUSINESS.
BUT ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES CAUTION THAT MUCH OF THE SPECULATION IN THESE
STOCKS MAY BE PREMATURE AND EVEN MISPLACED.
'TO BUY ANY OF THESE STOCKS ON THE BASIS OF SPECULATION IS WRONG' SAYS AN INDUSTRY
ANALYST WHO REQUESTS ANONYMITY. 'PEOPLE ARE BETTING WITHOUT ENOUGH INFORMATION.'
'THERE MAY BE TOO MUCH NEAR-TERM ENTHUSIASM' AGREES JOHN C. MUELLER SENIOR FINANCIAL
OFFICER AT WEST CO. ONE OF THE COMPANIES WHOSE STOCK HAS RISEN SHARPLY ON
SPECULATION THAT IT WILL BE A BIG WINNER. 'WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PHONE CALLS FROM BROKERS
AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE TELLING CLIENTS. OUR POSITION IS THAT WE WILL GET
SOME BUSINESS BUT HOW MUCH IS HARD TO TELL.'
WEST CO'S STOCK IS UP NEARLY 40 PC SINCE THE TYLENOL AFFAIR BROKE CLOSING YESTERDAY AT
21 DOWN 3-4. INTEREST IN REPACKAGING CENTERS ON PROPRIETARY OR OVER-THE-COUNTER
NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS. BUT WEST CO'S BUSINESS LARGELY IS IN THE PACKAGING OF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND IS CONCENTRATED ON INJECTABLE DRUGS.
MOST ANALYSTS HOWEVER THINK THE MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL MAKERS WILL SWITCH TO PLASTIC
FILM TO COVER EXISTING BOTTLES AND BOXES PLASTIC CAP SEALS AND SINGLE-DOSE PLASTIC
BUBBLES SUCH AS THOSE USED ON SOME COLD REMEDIES. - WEST CO. CURRENTLY IS UNABLE TO DO ANY OF THESE.
THE FDA REGULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE VERY BROAD AND MIRROR THE SUGGESTIONS
SUBMITTED TO IT BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SAYS IRA S. LOSS AN ANALYST WHO COVERS
THE AGENCY FOR WASHINGTON ANALYSIS CORP. A SUBSIDIARY OF PRUDENTIAL-BACHE SECURITIES
INC. 'I THINK THE SHRINK SEAL AROUND THE BOTTLE TOP WILL BE VERY POPULAR' SAYS LOSS. 'IT'S
THE CHEAPEST QUICKEST AND EASIEST WAY.' HE ADDS THAT SOME COMPANIES MAY OPT FOR A
PAPER SEAL OVER BOTTLE MOUTHS THAT CURRENTLY IS USED TO PACKAGE INSTANT COFFEE.
INDUSTRY OFFICIALS AGREE SUGGESTING THAT R.P. SCHERER CORP ANOTHER COMPANY WHOSE
STOCK SPECULATORS HAVE BID UP WILL SEE LITTLE BENEFIT FROM REPACKAGING MOVES.
SCHERER SEEMS TO AGREE. THE COMPANY IS A LEADING MAKER OF SOFT GELATIN CAPSULES
USED IN SOME VITAMIN PRODUCTS.
'I SUSPECT JOHNSON & JOHNSON -MAKER OF TYLENOL- WILL BE LOOKING TO INTRODUCE THE
TWO-PIECE HARD-SHELL CAPSULE THEY WERE USING BEFORE' SAYS A SCHERER SPOKESMAN.
'CONSUMERS SEE THOSE CAPSULES AS EASIER TO SWALLOW AND THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT
THEY ARE MORE THERAPEUTICALLY EFFECTIVE.'
THE SPOKESMAN ADDS THAT TYLENOL WOULD HAVE TO BE REFORMULATED INTO LIQUID FORM FOR
THE GELATIN CAPSULE TO BE APPLICABLE. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION THAT WOULD
Page 100 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

REQUIRE A NEW MARKETING APPROACH. 'LIKE THE DC-10' HE SAYS 'AFTER THE CLOUD GOES AWAY
WE'LL PROBABLY SEE THE HARD-SHELL CAPSULE FORM COME BACK VERY STRONG.'

SCHERER'S STOCK IS UP ABOUT THREE POINTS SINCE EARLY OCTOBER. IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT
17 5-8 BID DOWN 1-4.
AT LEAST ONE ANALYST HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE A CASE FOR A SWITCH TO GLASS BOTTLES
FROM PLASTIC, BUT MOST OBSERVERS THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH A CHANGE IS SLIM
PRIMARILY BECAUSE GLASS IS HEAVIER AND COSTS MORE TO SHIP. SUCH A MOVE WOULD BENEFIT
GLASS CONTAINER MAKERS SUCH AS BROCKWAY INC. AND ANCHOR HOCKING.
WHAT MAY BE THE MOST REVEALING LOOK AT THE PLANS OF MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL
MANUFACTURERS IS PROVIDED BY PACO PHARMACEUTICALS A LAKEWOOD N.J. PACKAGING
COMPANY THAT DERIVES 30% OF ITS REVENUE FROM SALES TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON. PACO WHICH
WENT PUBLIC LAST YEAR HAS ATTRACTED STRONG INVESTOR INTEREST SINCE THE TYLENOL
TRAGEDY BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO PRODUCE NINE OF THE 10 PACKAGING METHODS
PROPOSED TO THE FDA. THE STOCK HAS RISEN ABOUT 67% SINCE OCT. 1 QUOTED YESTERDAY AT
40 BID DOWN 3-4.
RUSSELL R. HAINES PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MEETING WITH INDUSTRY OFFICIALS AND SAYS 'THE
TREND RIGHT NOW IS TOWARD GLUED BOXES A PLASTIC BAND OVER THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE OR
PUTTING INNER SEALS OVER THE BOTTLE MOUTH. WE HAVEN'T TALKED TO ANYONE WHO IS
CHANGING THE BOTTLE DESIGN.'
RUSSELL SAYS THE COMPANY ALREADY IS HIRING EXTRA HELP IN ANTICIPATION OF A SURGE IN
BUSINESS ADDING- 'WE HAVE THE EQUIPMENT IN PLACE AND THE CAPACITY TO TAKE ON MORE
BUSINESS. '
BUT HE RECOGNIZES THAT ALL THE FUSS MAY BE SHORT-LIVED. 'SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE
THESE COMPANIES WILL HAVE THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT AND DO THEIR OWN PACKAGING. WE EXPECT
WE'LL STILL BE DOING MORE BUSINESS BUT IT ISN'T PRACTICAL TO SHIP PRODUCTS AROUND THE
COUNTRY TO GET THEM PACKAGED.'
IF AS HAINES SUGGESTS MOST MANUFACTURERS INITIALLY OPT FOR SOME KIND OF PLASTIC
COVERING THAT COMPLETELY SEALS THE PRODUCT COMPANIES WHO MAKE PLASTIC FILM WOULD
SEE THE MOST IMMEDIATE RESULTS. SOME OF THE LARGER FILM MAKERS ARE MINNESOTA MINING

The Irish company had only just introduced Tylenol extra strength into the Republic when cases of poisoning of
the drug in the US prompted the company to remove it from the market.
A spokesman for Johnson and Johnson (Ireland) stated that Tylenol extra strength had been withdrawn out of
concern at the possibility of someone tampering with retail packs. But the company's advertising campaign had
come under some criticism.
The campaign included television commercials devised by CDP Associates. It was cancelled three weeks before
television advertising was due to begin.
The campaign failed to win the approval of the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, which administers a code
of advertising standards for proprietary medicines. The FICI objected to claims that Tylenol was "absolutely safe"
and could have "no harmful side effects".
Tylenol, a paracetamol based product, was expected to do well in the I#6m pharmaceuticals retail market in the
Republic. The General Medical Services report for 1981 estimated that paracetamol was the third most
prescribed drug. Since the "delisting" of 875 items by the GMS, the analgesic market has opened up. Sterling
Winthrop, which markets Panadol and Hedex, has an opportunity to increase its sales substantially, perhaps
repromoting Panadol over the counter. The wider implication is that the over the counter market could grow at the
expense of the prescription market.

SUSPECT IN TYLENOL EXTORTION IS ARRESTED IN NEWARK

SUSPECT IN TYLENOL EXTORTION IS ARRESTED IN NEWARK

Copyright 1982 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.
A 35-year-old unemployed Newark man was arrested by Federal agents yesterday after two youths picked up a
package purportedly containing $100,000 that had been demanded in an extortion letter sent to Johnson &
Johnson, the parent company of the maker of Extra-Strength Tylenol, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
announced last night.
The man, identified as Vernon A. Williams Jr., was not regarded as a suspect in the deaths of seven persons who
took cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules in the Chicago area a month ago, the F.B.I. said.
Other law-enforcement officials said that the two youths who picked up the package were the suspect's sons,
aged 10 and 11. Money in Brown Paper Bag
James Cagnassola Jr., special agent in charge of the Newark Division, said the extortion letter, mailed from
Newark on Oct. 26, threatened the contamination and distribution of Tylenol unless the money was delivered in a
brown paper bag to a designated site in central Newark.
Such a paper bag was thrown from a public bus window toward a vacant lot, and the youths were seen picking it
up, Mr. Cagnassola reported. Agents then followed the boys to a cemetery, where they recovered the bag, he
added.
Mr. Cagnassola said Mr. Williams was arrested later in the day in East Orange. Law-enforcement authorities said
that the investigation was arranged after the threatening letter had been received at the New Brunswick, N.J.,
headquarters of Johnson & Johnson, whose McNeil Consumer Products division makes Extra-Strength Tylenol.
Mr. Cagnassola said that Mr. Williams was being held at the Somerset County jail in Somerville pending
arraignment Monday before a United States Magistrate in Newark on a charge of mailing a threatening
communication, a Federal offense punishable by 20 years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
Mr. Williams is the second suspect arrested on charges of attempted extortion in the Tylenol case. While a
number of extortion threats have been under investigation in the case, law-enforcement officials have made
public details on only three of them. Other Extortion Cases
In one case, a fugitive Missouri couple, James W. and Leann Lewis, have been charged with attempting to extort
$1 million from Johnson & Johnson. A letter bearing Mr. Lewis's fingerprints threatened further poisonings unless
the money was placed in a Chicago bank account.
Mr. Lewis, who has used the names Robert Richardson and Theodore Elmer Wilson, and his wife were staying at
the Hotel Rutledge in New York City when the poisonings occurred in the Chicago area from Sept. 29 to Oct. 1.
The Lewises were not listed as prime suspects in the killings.
In another case, Jerome Howard, 20, of Chicago, was arrested on Oct. 9 and accused of trying to extort $8,000
from Gottlieb Hospital in the Chicago suburb of Melrose Park by threatening to poison patients with Tylenol
capsules containing cyanide. The officials said there was ''no credible evidence'' to indicate that he was involved
in any of the deaths.
Earlier yesterday, The Chicago Tribune reported that it had received a letter, signed by ''Robert Richardson,''
disclaiming any responsibility for the seven cyanide poisonings. The newspaper said the letter came in a packet
Page 104 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

of materials sent through the mail, bearing a Wednesday postmark from New York City. The F.B.I. was examining
the letter, Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner said.
Preliminary handwriting analysis indicated that Mr. Lewis was the author, Mr. Fahner said. ''As you have probably
guessed, my wife and I have not committed the Chicago area Tylenol murders,'' the letter, written in neat script,
begins. ''We do not go around killing people. We never have and we never shall.'' The words not and never are
underscored.

U.S. Tax Credit Helps Chrysler Earn Profit For Third Quarter; Texaco Income Off

Chrysler Corp., which this week averted a strike over a wage dispute with hourly workers, yesterday reported a
third-quarter profit of $9.4 million (3 cents a share) compared with a $140.1 million loss in the comparable period
last year.
However, the profit by the No. 3 automaker was due not to successful car sales but to a federal tax credit of $20.7
million. Chrysler sustained an operating loss of $11.3 million for the quarter.
Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson Inc. reported that the national withdrawal of its Tylenol pain-reliever capsules
reduced third-quarter earnings by $50 million (27 cents a share).
The pharmaceutical giant, which was on the way to one of its best years in history before poisoned Tylenol
capsules killed seven people in Chicago, said that its net profits for the quarter were down 26 percent from the
year before.
And Texaco Inc., the nation's third-largest oil company, said yesterday that earnings tumbled 48.7 percent in the
third quarter because the worldwide recession has slowed demand for petroleum products.
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca noted in a statement that this is the first time since 1977 that the automaker has
recorded three straight profitable quarters.
It also was the first time in five years that Chrysler has reported a profit in a third quarter, traditionally the
industry's worst because of new-model changeover costs. The last third-quarter profit was in 1977, when the
company made $33.7 million.
This year's nine-month earnings were $266.2 million ($3.23). Chrysler lost $408.7 million ($6.21) during the same
period last year.
Chrysler reported worldwide sales in the third quarter of $2.5 billion, up from $2.3 billion last year. Worldwide
vehicle factory sales in the quarter were 284,601, off 2.3 percent from 291,403 last year.
Nine-month sales totaled $7.8 billion versus $7.4 billion last year. Worldwide vehicle factory sales were 926,152,
compared with 981,938.
Johnson & Johnson Inc. said that earnings for the quarter before the $50 million charge were $146.5 million (78
cents a share) compared with $129.9 million (69 cents) last year. The $50 million charge shaved the figure to
$96.5 million (51 cents). Sales were $1.48 billion against $1.34 billion.
The recall costs aside, nine-month net profits would have been $444 million ($2.37), up 17.2 percent from $378.9
million ($2.03) a year earlier, the company said. Because of the extraordinary expense, however, the figure slid to
a 4 percent increase from the first nine months of 1981 to $394 million ($2.10). Nine-month sales were $4.38
billion, up 9.3 percent from $4.01 billion.
Johnson & Johnson spokesman Robert V. Andrews said the withdrawal of Tylenol capsules will negatively affect
Tylenol sales and overall company earnings in the fourth quarter and "into 1983."
Andrews said he could not project what the overall impact would be for the company. He added that the company
is designing a tamper-resistant package and plans to invest heavily to reestablish the pain reliever on the market.
Tylenol was the best-selling nonprescription pain reliever in the country prior to the Chicago poisonings.

Texaco Inc.'s third-quarter earnings plummeted to $303 million ($1.16 a share) from $589 million ($2.25) in the
third quarter of 1981. Revenues were off 18 percent to $11.8 million from $14.4 million.
Nine-month earnings were $975 million ($3.74) compared with a record $1.8 billion ($6.79) in the same 1981
period. Revenue fell to $36.3 billion from $44.7 billion.
Texaco's U.S. energy earnings fell 38 1/2 percent to $156 million, primarily on lower oil and gas production,
reduced crude-oil prices and higher dry-hole expenses. Foreign energy earnings were down 53.2 percent,
reflecting continued high costs of acquiring crude oil.
High interest costs and losses on foreign currency translations produced a net loss of $28.9 million for Pan
American World Airways in the third quarter in contrast to a profit of $281.5 million ($3.95 a share) a year ago, the
airline reported yesterday.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.--JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS STARTING TO FIGHT BACK. FOUR WEEKS AFTER
SEVEN CHICAGO-AREA CONSUMERS DIED FROM SWALLOWING EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL
CAPSULES LACED WITH CYANIDE, J&J IS TAKING THE FIRST CAUTIOUS STEPS TO REBUILD
TYLENOL'S IMAGE.
MCNEIL CONSUMER PRODUCTS CO., THE J&J SUBSIDIARY THAT MAKES TYLENOL, IS STARTING A
DRIVE TO CORRECT MANY MISPERCEPTIONS IDENTIFIED IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLS THAT IT
COMMISSIONED.
THE POLLS FOUND THAT MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT ONLY TYLENOL CAPSULES--AND NOT
TABLETS--HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE POISONINGS. THE SURVEYS ALSO FOUND MANY PEOPLE
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT AUTHORITIES HAD EXONERATED THE COMPANY IN THE POISONINGS AND THAT
THE DEATHS WERE CONFINED TO THE CHICAGO AREA.
THE POLLS ALSO SHOWED THAT HALF OF TYLENOL'S PREVIOUS USERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES
UNLIKELY TO USE THE PRODUCT AGAIN.
THIS WEEK MCNEIL AIRED TYLENOL TELEVISION COMMERCIALS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE SEPT.
30, RIGHT AFTER NEWS OF THE FIRST POISONINGS BROKE. DR. THOMAS N. GATES, MCNEIL'S
MEDICAL DIRECTOR, STRESSES THAT THE POISONINGS OCCURRED ONLY IN THE CHICAGO AREA
AND INVOLVED ONLY TYLENOL CAPSULES.
MCNEIL ALSO HAS SENT ABOUT 2 MILLION PIECES OF LITERATURE TO DOCTORS, DENTISTS, NURSES
AND PHARMACISTS SPREADING THE WORD THAT THE COMPANY'S FACTORIES WEREN'T THE
SOURCE OF THE POISONINGS. THE MESSAGES ASK RECIPIENTS TO HELP REASSURE PATIENTS AND
CUSTOMERS THAT TYLENOL IN TABLET, LIQUID OR CHEWABLE FORMS ISN'T AT RISK. THE COMPANY
ALSO ENLISTED ITS SALES FORCE AND THAT OF OTHER J&J PRODUCTS TO PROMOTE THIS
MESSAGE.
MCNEIL IS PUSHING HARD WITHIN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY LARGELY BECAUSE CONSUMER
SURVEYS SHOWED THAT 80% OF ALL TYLENOL USERS FIRST BEGAN USING THE PRODUCT AT THE
SUGGESTION OF THEIR DOCTOR, DENTIST OR DRUGGIST.
SO FAR, THE COMPANY SAYS, AN OUTSIDE RESEARCH CONCERN, WHICH J&J DECLINES TO NAME,
HAS INTERVIEWED "HUNDREDS" OF CONSUMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS SURVEY WORK
INDEFINITELY. A SIX-MEMBER "STRATEGY GROUP," WHICH MEETS SEVERAL HOURS A DAY, HAS
WATCHED INTERVIEWS ON FILM, STUDYING REACTIONS TO TYLENOL, OTHER OVER-THE-COUNTER
MEDICINES AND J&J ITSELF.
J&J ALSO HOPES TO BRING BACK CUSTOMERS BY PRODUCING QUICKLY A TAMPER-RESISTANT
PACKAGE FOR ITS CAPSULE PRODUCTS. THE FDA IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE RULES NEXT WEEK
REQUIRING TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGES FOR ALL NON-PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, BUT J&J AND
OTHERS ARE MOVING BEFORE THE RULES COME OUT.
J&J IS CONSIDERING "SEVERAL" ADDITIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING OPTIONS. AMONG OTHER
POSSIBILITIES, IT IS EXPECTED TO PROMOTE NEW TAMPER-RESISTANT PACKAGING. IT ALSO MIGHT
PUSH TYLENOL TABLETS, RATHER THAN THE CAPSULES.

Page 110 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

IN THE WEEKS SINCE THE POISONING NEWS, TYLENOL SALES HAVE DECLINED NEARLY 80%, J&J
SAYS. COMPETITORS ARE MOVING HARD TO GET A SHARE OF TYLENOL'S BUSINESS.
BUT J&J APPEARS TO BE BENEFITTING FROM CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC LOYALTY IN THE CRISIS. MANY
STORES ARE STILL HOLDING OPEN THE SHELF SPACE ONCE USED FOR TYLENOL EXTRA-STRENGTH
CAPSULES. THE COMPANY EVEN RECEIVED A $10 CHECK (WHICH IT RETURNED) FROM A DONOR
WHO WANTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE $100,000 REWARD J&J IS OFFERING FOR INFORMATION
LEADING TO CAPTURE OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POISONINGS.

CHGO -DJ- CYANIDE-LACED CAPSULES IN THE EIGHTH TAINTED BOTTLE OF EXTRA-STRENGTH
TYLENOL ARE 'SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT' FROM PREVIOUS BOTTLES RAISING THE POSSIBILITY
THAT MORE THAN ONE PERSON MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POISONING AN OFFICIAL SAYS.
'THE -LATEST- BOTTLE IS CLEARLY DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER SEVEN' ILLINOIS ATTORNEY
GENERAL TYRONE FAHNER SAID LAST NIGHT.
THE DIFFERENCE ALSO SUGGESTS MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CYANIDE MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED
FAHNER SAID.
AFTER SEVEN DEATHS IN THE CHICAGO AREA BETWEEN SEPT. 29 AND OCT. 1 FROM
CYANIDE-TAINTED TYLENOL CAPSULES AUTHORITIES RECOVERED EIGHT BOTTLES OF THE
POISONED PAIN RELIEVER - FIVE RELATED TO THE DEATHS TWO TURNED IN BY CONSUMERS AND
ONE ON A STORE SHELF THAT HAD NOT BEEN SOLD.
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LATEST BOTTLE SUGGESTS IT 'MAY BE UNRELATED TO THE OTHER
BOTTLES SO FAR RECOVERED' SAID FAHNER WHO HEADS A TASK FORCE INVESTIGATING THE
SEVEN DEATHS.
'THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THE MIXTURE OF CYANIDE AND TYLENOL IS SUBSTANTIALLY
DIFFERENT' FAHNER SAID.
THE POISONED MEDICINE HAD AN ORANGISH COLOR AND A LACK OF THE DETERIORATION NOTED IN
PREVIOUS CAPSULES AND 'SOME -CAPSULES- WERE PUT TOGETHER UNARTFULLY' HE SAID.
BUT FAHNER ADDED- 'I WILL DRAW NO INFERENCES NOW REGARDING THE ANOMALIES WITH THE
EIGHTH BOTTLE. IT MAY INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON BEING INVOLVED.
BUT I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT.'

TYLENOL RECALL EXPENSE IS PUT AT $100 MILLION

TYLENOL RECALL EXPENSE IS PUT AT $100 MILLION

Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would spend $100 million to withdraw Tylenol capsules from the market
and cover the other expenses arising from the contamination of some capsules.
The estimate was part of the big pharmaceutical company's thirdquarter earnings report. The company said the
costs connected with the Tylenol capsule poisoning had reduced net income for the quarter by 25.7 percent, to
$96.5 million, or 61 cents a share.
Although the total cost was put at $100 million, the final cost after allowing for tax savings was entered on the
books at $50 million.
Expenses connected with the contamination will continue through the fourth quarter and into 1983, the company
said. But the entire amount was charged against the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30.
In the final days of last month, authorities warned the public that some Tylenol capsules, mainly in the Chicago
area, had been laced with cyanide. The poisoning, which investigators said occurred in tampering after the
Tylenol bottles left the manufacturer, resulted in seven deaths in the area.
The third-quarter net income of $96.5 million compared with earnings of $129.9 million, or 69 cents a share, in the
corresponding quarter a year earlier. Sales increased to $1.48 billion, from $1.34 billion. Costs Involved in Recall
Early this month, Johnson & Johnson began the recall of all regular and Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules
because of concern that other capsules might have been tampered with.
Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., said the $100 million in expenses included the costs
of the nationwide capsule withdrawal, disposal of the capsules and the costs involved in such other matters as
communications with physicians, consumers and drugstores.
The $50 million charge was equal to 27 cents a share, the company said. F. Robert Kniffin, director of public
relations for Johnson & Johnson, said that any store that had already paid for Tylenol capsules that had to be
returned to the manufacturer would be reimbursed for that inventory, with the company picking up the shipping
costs involved in the recall.
Consumers who have returned capsules directly or through the mail to Johnson & Johnson are to receive
coupons to exchange for Tylenol in tablet form, the company said.
Johnson & Johnson, which also manufactures such products as toiletries, baby care items, first-aid products and
other drug items, said the capsule-tampering in the Chicago area would negatively affect Tylenol sales and
overall company earnings in the fourth quarter and next year.
''Johnson & Johnson's operating earnings exceeded my expectations and I was impressed that the third-quarter
net, excluding the onetime recall expense, was up about 13 percent on a per-share basis,'' said David Saks, an
analyst at A.G. Becker Inc. Eventual Impact Unknown
''The company has successfully introduced Zomax, a prescription pain killer and Nizoral, an antifungal in tablet
form,'' Mr. Saks said. ''These new products should go a long way to offsetting the negative impact of the Tylenol
capsule withdrawal.'' He noted that Johnson & Johnson's drug subsidiaries - McNeil Pharmaceutical, which
Page 114 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

manufactures Tylenol, the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation and Janssen Pharmaceutical - rank among the
fastest-growing prescription drug operations in the world.
Johnson & Johnson said that Tylenol had been a major incomeproducing drug and that it planned ''to invest
heavily to reestablish the brand's market position.'' The company said, however, that the extent of the potential
adverse impact of the poison scare is unknown. Sales of all Tylenol products had been projected at more than
$400 million in 1982.

Tylenol maker hit by Dollars 50m cost of recalling capsules

Tylenol maker hit by Dollars 50m cost of recalling capsules

JOHNSON and Johnson, the US pharmaceutical and health care group, has set aside Dollars 50m in its
third-quarter accounts to cover the cost of recalling and destroying 22m bottles of Tylenol capsules.
Seven people died last month in the Chicago area after taking extra strength Tylenol - a popular painkilling drug which had been contaminated with cyanide after it had left the factory.
The Dollars 50m charge was in line with Wall Street expectations and lowered Johnson and Johnson third quarter
earnings from Dollars 129.9m last year to Dollars 96.5m.
The charge also curtailed nine-month earnings to Dollars 394m, nonetheless slightly up on the Dollars 378.9m for
the first nine months of last year.
Third-quarter sales increased to Dollars 1.5bn from Dollars 1.3bn, while nine-month sales rose to Dollars 4.4bn
from Dollars 4bn.
The company warned that the affair of the contaminated capsules would hit the company's sales and earnings in
the final quarter and also next year.
It reaffirmed its commitment to Tylenol and said yesterday it plans to invest heavily to re-establish the market
position of the brand.
Tylenol has been a major contributor to Johnson and Johnson earnings and revenues. Sales of the drug last year
totalled about Dollars 400m accounting for about 7 per cent of the company's revenues. The product is
understood to have earned about Dollars 70m last year or the equivalent of about 15 per cent of total earnings.
Although the recall has affected only Tylenol capsules, which have accounted for about 35 per cent of all Tylenol
sales, the Chicago tragedy has also an impact on sales of the drug in tablet form.
The company this week started an advertising campaign on prime-time television to revive sales of the product
although Wall Street and the drug industry in general regard this as an uphill struggle.
For its part, the Federal Drug Administration is expected to announce new rules for the packaging of
over-the-counter drugs either today or early next week, in order to make bottles tamper-proof. A sense of urgency
prevails throughout the industry and the regulatory bodies because of the increasing number of 'copy cat'
tampering incidents throughout the US involving other popular and readily available drugs, extending also to
consumer products generally and in some cases sweets.

English
(Copyright (c) 1982, Dow Jones & Co., Inc.)
MAKERS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICINES SAY THAT THE RASH OF PRODUCT TAMPERINGS
FOLLOWING THE TYLENOL POISONINGS HAS SPURRED THEM TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE
PACKAGING, SOME OF WHICH MAY ARRIVE ON STORE SHELVES AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK.
SEVERAL INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SAY THAT THESE MOVES AND FUTURE, MORE PERMANENT,
PROTECTIVE PACKAGING MAY COST DRUG MANUFACTURERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
CHARLES PERGOLA, PRESIDENT OF NORCLIFF THAYER INC., A UNIT OF REVLON INC., SAYS THAT THE
BIGGEST COST MAY NOT BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PACKAGING, BUT THE COST OF REPLACING
PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT AREN'T TAMPER RESISTANT.
IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS, REPORTS HAVE SURFACED OF OTHER NON-PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT
HAVE BEEN ADULTERATED. OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE INCIDENTS APPEAR TO BE "COPYCATS" OF THE
CYANIDE-LACED TYLENOL CAPSULES, AND THAT THEY WEREN'T UNEXPECTED.
YESTERDAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT A MAN IN DENVER BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL AFTER TAKING
EXCEDRIN BRAND ASPIRIN CAPSULES LACED WITH TOXIC MERCURIC CHLORIDE. MONDAY, RAT
POISON WAS FOUND IN A BOTTLE OF ANACIN CAPSULES IN THE DENVER AREA. IN THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, OCCURRENCES OF TAINTED MOUTHWASHES, EYEDROPS, NOSEDROPS, AND EVEN
CHOCOLATE PIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. EXCEDRIN IS MANUFACTURED BY BRISTOL-MYERS CO.
AND ANACIN IS MADE BY AMERICAN HOME PRODICTS CORP.
TWO WEEKS AGO, THE PROPRIETARY ASSOCIATION, A TRADE GROUP OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUG
MAKERS, ASKED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CREATE REGULATIONS REQUIRING ALL MAKERS
TO USE ONE OF 11 METHODS TO PROTECT CONTAINERS FROM TAMPERING.
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTATION IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE THE RULES AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK.
BUT INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SAY THAT SEVERAL COMPANIES AREN'T WAITING FOR THE NEW RULES.
AT NORCLIFF THAYER, WHICH MAKES TUMS ANTACIDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS, MR. PERGOLA SAID
THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS NEXT WEEK TO BEGIN SHIPPING PRODUCTS WITH GLUED CARTONS
AND FOILED DISKS ON ITS BOTTLES.
PERGOLA SAID THAT NORCLIFF THAYER'S ACTION IS ONLY AN INTERIM STEP. HE SAID THAT GLUING
CARTONS WAS SOMETHING THAT ONLY MAKERS WITH SMALLER-SIZED PRODUCTS COULD DO
IMMEDIATELY. MORE PERMANENT PROTECTIVE PACKAGES, ALONG WITH WARNING LABELS, WILL
BECOME AVAILABLE "AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE," SAID JOHN WALDEN, SENIOR VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE PROPRIETARY ASSOCIATION. HE SAID MANY COMPANIES HAVE ACQUIRED THE
NECESSARY EQUIPMENT, BUT INDICATIONS EXIST THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF MACHINERY.

TO INVESTORS JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S ATTRACTIVENESS IN RECENT YEARS HAD BEEN ITS
PREDICTABILITY. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF ITS PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND
CONSUMER-HEALTH PRODUCTS THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCK-PRICE GREW ROBUSTLY. BUT THE
TYLENOL INCIDENT HAS SHAKEN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AS BADLY AS IT HAS CONSUMER
CONFIDENCE.
IN THE FIRST WEEKS FOLLOWING THE NEWS THAT EXTRA-STRENGTH TYLENOL CAPSULES
ADULTERATED WITH DYANIDE KILLED SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE CHICAGO AREA JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S
STOCK FELL AS LOW AS 39 A 17% PLUNGE. IT SINCE HAS BOUNCED BACK A BIT CLOSING YESTERDAY
IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE TRADING AT 41 1-4 OFF 2 3-8.
BUT WHILE SOME VETERAN WALL STREET WATCHERS BELIEVE ITS CURRENT PRICE IS A FAIR
REFLECTION OF WHAT THE TYLENOL MESS WILL COST JOHNSON & JOHNSON IN LOST PROFIT A
STRONG MINORITY SAYS THE COMPANY IS BEING UNFAIRLY PENALIZED BECAUSE OF A
STILL-FRIGHTENED PUBLIC. 'THE STOCK'S SHARP DECLINE WAS PART OF THE PUBLIC PANIC DURING
THE FIRST NEWS REPORTS' ASSERTS JAMES L. TULLIS A MORGAN STANLEY HEALTH-CARE
INDUSTRY ANALYST. MR. TULLIS LAST WEEK REAFFIRMED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE COMPANY
CALLING THE STOCK 'A GOOD BUY' AT THE PRESENT PRICE. - WHAT IS STRONGLY EXPECTED IS THAT JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS
SCHEDULED TO BE ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK SHOULD TAKE QUOTE A WALLOP. ANALYSTS SAY THE
COMPANY WILL TAKE A ONE-TIME CHARGE AGAINST EARNINGS OF 25 CENTS TO 35 CENTS A SHARE
THE COST OF RECALLING AND DESTROYING 22 MILLION BOTTLES OF TYLENOL CAPSULES. THE
TOTAL COST IS EXPECTED TO BE $50 MILLION TO $60 MILLION AFTER TAXES.
BASED ON THIS-PLUS THE EXPECTED LOSS OF SALES DUE TO THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY ON THE
BRAND AND THE COST OF PRODUCING NEW TAMPER- RESISTANT PACKAGING AND NEW
ADVERTISING- ANALYSTS SAY JOHNSON & JOHNSON WILL POST YEAR-END EARNINGS THAT WILL BE
FLAT OR SLIGHTLY BELOW THE $2.51 A SHARE REPORTED LAST YEAR. PRIOR TO THE TYLENOL
INCIDENT ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED A 16% RISE IN PROFIT TO ABOUT $2.90 OR 2.95 A SHARE.
BUT DOUBT OVER HOW MUCH TYLENOL SALES WILL BE LOST IN COMING MONTHS AND CONCERN
OVER WHETHER JOHNSON & JOHNSON CAN EVEN RESUSCITATE THE BRAND HAVE CLOUDED THE
CURRENT OUTLOOK. LAST YEAR TYLENOL SALES NUDGED THE $400 MILLION LEVEL ACCOUNTING
FOR ABOUT 7% OF CORPORATE REVENUE. BUT ANALYSTS SAY THE PRODUCT EARNED ABOUT $70
MILLION ROUGHLY 15% OF TOTAL NET.
THOUGH ONLY EXTRA-STRENGTH CAPSULES WERE IMPLICATED IN THE DEATHS AND ONLY THAT
FORM OF THE BRAND-ABOUT 35% OF ALL TYLENOL SALES-WAS REMOVED FROM STORES MARKET
SOURCES SAY FRIGHTENED CONSUMERS ARE SHYING AWAY FROM TYLENOL TABLETS TOO.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAYS IT WILL RESUME ALL CAPSULE SALES WHEN ITS NEW PROTECTIVE
PACKAGING IS READIED.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAYS IT IS CONFIDENT IT WILL SUCCESSFULLY REVIVE THE BRAND THOUGH IT
CONCEDES IT HAS A 'DIFFICULT TASK AHEAD' AND THAT AT LEAST FOR 1983 TYLENOL REVENUE
WON'T DO AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED.
DAVID TALBOT OF DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT EXPECTS THAT EVEN IF THE COMPANY BEGINS
AGGRESSIVELY MARKETING THE PRODUCT TYLENOL SALES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER COULD BE
DOWN BY NEARLY 80% TO ABOUT $25 MILLION. 'INSTEAD OF CONTRIBUTING 10 CENTS A SHARE THE
PRODUCT WILL COST THE COMPANY ABOUT SIX CENTS' A SHARE FOR THE QUARTER HE PROJECTS.
HE ADDS 'I'M RECOMMENDING A HOLD ON THE STOCK UNTIL SOME FACTORS HAVE GREATER
VISIBILITY. WHAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT-MANAGED PREDICTABLE COMPANIES HAS BEEN
THROWN OUT OF KILTER AND WE'D RATHER STAND ASIDE FOR A WHILE.'
JOSEPH RICCARDO AN ANALYST WITH BEAR STEARNS BELIEVES THAT JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S 1983

AND 14% DOWN FROM 16.7% IN 1981. HE EXPECTS SHARPLY REDUCED TYLENOL SALES OF $200
MILLION NEXT YEAR. CONSEQUENTLY TYLENOL WILL CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO CORPORATE
EARNINGS AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY 'MUST TAKE UP THE SLACK' HE ADDS. - RICCARDO EXPECTS THE COMPANY'S MEDICAL EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES TO GROW SHARPLY DUE IN
PART TO THE TURNAROUND IN ITS TECHNICARE MEDICAL IMAGING BUSINESS WHICH HAS
REGISTERED LOSSES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. BUT HE SAYS GROWTH IN THE COMPANY'S
CONSUMER AND ETHICAL DRUG BUSINESSES WILL SLOW. FIGURING A 13.8 EARNINGS MULTIPLE HE
SAYS 'JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S SHARES APPEAR FIARLY VALUED.'

OVERALL STRENGTH WON'T BE HURT DRASTICALLY AND THAT THE TOTAL IMPACT OF THE TYLENOL
SITUATION WILL BE ELIMINATED IN '12 TO 18 MONTHS.'
DAVID LOTHSON A KIDDER PEABODY ANALYST SAYS DECLINE IN TYLENOL SALES TO ABOUT $300
MILLION TO $350 MILLION IN 1983 WOULD STILL PROVIDE ABOUT 20 CENTS TO 40 CENTS TO OVERALL

CHICAGO, Oct. 25 -- An eighth bottle of Extra-Strength Tylenol has been found to contain cyanide, Illinois
Attorney General Tyrone Fahner announced tonight.
The 50-capsule bottle, believed to have been purchased at Frank's Finer Foods in Wheaton, a western suburb of
Chicago, was returned by a consumer to the Wheaton Police Department.
A litmus test conducted by laboratory technicians of the McNeil Consumer Products Company indicated the
probable presence of cyanide. The bottle, now at a McNeil facility at Fort Washington, Pa., will be taken to the
laboratory of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington on Tuesday for laser analysis and detection of
fingerprints. The bottle will then be sent to a Food and Drug Administration facility in Cincinnati for trace analysis
of cyanide.
One other bottle of contaminated Tylenol was found among the bottles returned by consumers; one was found
among the bottles pulled from the store shelves, and five were connected with the seven Tylenol deaths.
Earlier today The Chicago Sun-Times reported that an unidentified relative of one of the seven victims is being
investigated in the deaths.
However, Cmdr. Kenneth Curin, head of the Chicago Police Department's investigation, said that there was still
''no prime suspect'' in the case. A spokesman for the state task force investigating the poison deaths had no
comment, and an investigator for the State Department of Law Enforcement refused to give much credence to the
report.
That development, one of a long series of initially credible leads to be reported in the Chicago press, is only one
of many being investigated. 'Violent Argument' Reported
The relative, possibly one of eight or nine leads from a shifting list, is said to have had a ''violent argument with
his kin'' late in September. The poisonings occurred from Sept. 29 to Oct. 1. The suspect is also said to be a
''long-time friend'' of Roger Arnold, a 48-year-old Chicagoan arrested on firearms charges and questioned Oct. 11
about the Tylenol poisonings, according to The Sun-Times.
Mr. Arnold appeared for a while to be a promising lead in the investigation because of his interest in poisons, his
collection of literature on killing people, and his employment at Jewel Food Stores, where Howard Fearon Sr., the
father of one victim, Mary Reiner, also works. ---- Man Who Took Excedrin Is Ill By The Associated Press
William Sinkovic, 33 years old, of Aurora, Colo., was in critical condition last night in Denver after taking three
extra-strength Excedrin capsules that initial tests indicated might be contaminated with toxic mercuric chloride, a
chemical used in mercury batteries.
The announcement was made last last night by Dr. Barry Rumack of the Rocky Mountain Poison Control center.
The Federal Food and Drug Administration ordered all Colorado stores to remove Excedrin from their shelves.
Harry Levine, a spokesman for the Bristol Myers Company in New York, manufacturer of Excedrin, said early
today that he was still getting information from Colorado and would have no immediate comment.
Earlier yesterday, Mr. Rumack's agency said an odd-looking aspirin capsule turned in by a suspicious consumer
contained the rat poison warfarin.

NEW YORK - JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN TO REVIVE SALES OF ITS TYLENOL
PRODUCTS, SOME THREE WEEKS AFTER SEVEN PEOPLE DIED FROM SWALLOWING
CYANIDE-TAINTED CAPSULES.
OVER THE WEEKEND JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOUGHT AD TIME ON THE THREE MAJOR NETWORKS.
VIEWERS WERE URGED "TO CONTINUE TO TRUST TYLENOL" BY THOMAS N. GATES, MEDICAL
DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY'S MCNEIL CONSUMER PRODUCTS UNIT, WHICH MARKETS THE PAIN
RELIEVER. A SPOKESMAN SAID THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD BE AIRED AT NIGHT "ON A HEAVY
SCHEDULE" AND CONTINUE UNTIL WEDNESDAY; THE OFFICIAL WOULDN'T ESTIMATE THE COST.
THE TV TIME REPRESENTS THE FIRST COMMERCIAL MESSAGE ABOUT TYLENOL SINCE THE
COMPANY PULLED ALL COMMERCIALS OFF THE AIR ON OCT. 1, A DAY AFTER THE CYANIDE DEATHS
WERE FIRST REPORTED. SINCE THEN THE COMPANY HASN'T ADVERTISED THE TYLENOL BRAND.
THE MESSAGE IS THE SECOND PUBLIC STATEMENT MADE BY MCNEIL'S DR. GATES WITHIN THE
WEEK. IN A LETTER DATED LAST TUESDAY AND SENT TO ABOUT 61,000 DOCTORS NATIONWIDE, DR.
GATES OUTLINED STEPS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE TAMPERING WITH ITS
PRODUCTS; THOSE STEPS INCLUDE VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF TYLENOL CAPSULES.
IN BOTH THE TELEVISION MESSAGE AND THE LETTER TO DOCTORS, DR. GATES REQUESTED THAT
PATIENTS USE THE NON-CAPSULE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, HE ANNOUNCED THAT MCNEIL WILL
RESUME SELLING CAPSULES IN TAMPER-RESISTANCE CONTAINERS "AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
THERE HAS BEEN MUCH SPECULATION AMONG MARKET WATCHERS AS TO HOW AND WHEN MCNEIL
WOULD BEGIN WHAT MANY CONSIDER AN UPHILL BATTLE TO RESTORE TYLENOL SALES. IN RECENT
WEEKS MARKET SOURCES SAY THAT SALES OF ALL TYLENOL PRODUCTS HAVE SLIPPED MORE THAN
25%. BEFORE THE CYANIDE-RELATED DEATHS, TYLENOL WAS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT $430
MILLION IN SALES.
COMPANY OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT MARKET SURVEYS INDICATE A DEEP "RESERVOIR" OF GOOD
WILL AND TRUST FOR TYLENOL AMONG THE U.S. PUBLIC.

CHICAGO, Oct. 22 -- The Food and Drug Administration today officially cleared the subsidiary of the Johnson &
Johnson Company that makes Tylenol of any responsibility for the contamination of pain-relief capsules that
killed seven residents of the Chicago area.
A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, parent of the McNeil Consumer Products Company, said the company had
received a letter from the F.D.A. confirming that the cyanide contamination had not occurred at the company's
plants in Fort Washington, Pa., or Round Rock, Tex.
Joseph P. Hile, associate commissioner for regulatory affairs at the F.D.A., said in the letter, ''We conclude that
the contamination did not occur at either plant and was the result of tampering after the capsules had been
shipped to distribution points, and most likely after they reached the retail shelves.''
A criminal investigation into the killings, which occurred three weeks ago, has been based on the theory that the
capsules were poisoned after they reached retail stores.
News of the poisonings had depressed Johnson & Johnson stock. Today it fell 62 1/2 cents, to $43.625, $2.50
above its level in early October.
In New Brunswick, N.J., the headquarters of Johnson & Johnson, a spokesman said the company would begin
60-second television messages Sunday evening with their medical director discussing the Tylenol contamination.
Dr. Thomas N. Gates, medical director for McNeil, will appear in spots on the three major networks telling the
public, ''We want you to continue to trust Tylenol.''
Dr. Gates says in the message that the company urges consumers to use Tylenol in tablet form until it
''reintroduces capsules in tamper-resistant containers.'' Manufacture of the capsules was halted earlier this
month. Lawrence G. Foster, vice president of public relations, said no final decision had been made on the new
packaging.

Another cyanide-loaded bottle of Extra-Strength Tylenol was found here today by investigators checking bottles
ordered pulled from the shelves or returned by consumers earlier this month, officials said.
A laboratory set up in suburban Chicago by McNeil Consumer Products Co., which manufactures the
over-the-counter painkiller, was routinely examining thousands of returned Tylenol bottles when it found the
cyanide-tainted one.
The bottle came from Dominick's Finer Foods, which is located a half block west of the Walgreen's drugstore in
Chicago where the seventh reported Tylenol-poisoning victim, flight attendant Paula Prince, bought her capsules
Sept. 29.
Officials believe that the 50-capsule bottle was returned by a customer, and they are working with Dominick's
employes to locate whoever purchased it.
Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner said tonight that investigators "believe the only person to have touched
the inside of the bottle was the person who put the poisoned capsules there. . . ." He added that lab technicians
would use a new laser technology in an attempt to lift fingerprints from the capsules.
Fahner said he believed the bottle had been returned by a customer because it was logged at the laboratory as
being without the box in which the product is normally packaged.
The contaminated bottle was found, Fahner said, when technicians rubbed a piece of litmus paper on the inside
of the bottle cap and it tested positive. Then they removed the cotton from the bottle, saw that four or five
capsules were discolored, put back the cotton and immediately sent the bottle to the police.
Police Superintendent Richard Brzeczek said the bottle "had a substantially larger number of contaminated
capsules" -- more than 14 -- than any of the six other adulterated bottles officials have found.
Fahner said that investigators had tested "well in excess of a couple hundred thousand" bottles of Tylenol in the
metropolitan Chicago area, where all of the deaths occurred.
Brzeczek said it was "significant" that the lot number on the latest contaminated bottle was the same -- MC2880 -as that taken by four of the seven victims, all of whom died between Sept. 29 and Oct. 1.
Meanwhile, police and FBI agents in New York City said they were working on the assumption that James W.
Lewis, wanted for questioning in the Tylenol killings, and his wife, Leann, were still in the city.
On Saturday the Lewises checked out of the Rutledge Hotel, where they reportedly had been living in a
$95-per-week room since Sept. 6.
"If he's in New York, we expect to get him, no question," said Capt. Eugene Burke.
About 50 calls have been logged at two New York hotline numbers publicized Wednesday, some with leads that
had to be followed up, but no "hot" clues, he said.
A photo of the bearded Lewis, who is wanted on a federal warrant for trying to extort $1 million from McNeil
Consumer Products, led a hotel resident to call police this week.

After interviewing residents at the old hotel on Lexington Avenue and checking fingerprints, the FBI determined
the couple had stayed at the hotel, under the alias Richardson.
FBI officials have emphasized that Lewis is not a suspect in the deaths and that they have "no evidence" to link
him to them. They do say, however, that they want to talk to him about the killings.
At a news conference here Wednesday, Chief of Detectives James Sullivan said: "We don't think there was
traveling back and forth between New York and Chicago . The woman was working regularly during that time and
her husband was seen with her."
As the search for the couple continued, two people in the Boston area were detained and questioned because
they resembled the Lewises.
Boston police who arrested a woman Wednesday night on a bad-check charge said they questioned her because
she looked like Mrs. Lewis and had Illinois identification. No connection was established.
Police in Hingham, Mass., a seashore town south of Boston, questioned a professor from Ohio State University,
who later asked that his name not be released. The man and his wife were in Massachusetts for a conference.
"He was a dead ringer," Officer John Lynch said of the professor. Lynch said the only difference between the two
men was eye color. Lewis' are brown, the professor's blue.
Meanwhile, Fahner, the Illinois attorney general, said that an enhancement of a photograph taken in the
Walgreen's store at the time Prince was buying her poisoned capsules is not going to help much in the case.
Earlier this week Fahner had said that a bearded man in the background of the photo resembled Lewis, but a
former employer said the man in the photo was not Lewis. Fahner said the photographic enhancement will
indicate the man's height and weight.

The Fear Of Buying; The Challenge of Rebuilding Public Confidence

The People versus Extra-Strength Tylenol is a case without precedent. No mass murderer, until now, has seized
on a popular product as his murder weapon. No product has ever disappeared so suddenly and dramatically from
so many millions of homes and stores.
But as public relations and marketing experts size up the Tylenol killings and Johnson & Johnson's reaction, they
need not form their judgments in a vacuum. They can and do draw on the painful lessons of dozens of other
companies and products that, over the last two decades, have had to defend themselves in trying or tragic
circumstances.
Beginning with the great cranberry scare of 1959, American businesses have endured a series of crises over the
Chevrolet Corvair, tuna fish, Bon Vivant vichyssoise, the Firestone 500, the Ford Pinto, the DC10, the Rely
tampon and others.
The future of Tylenol is a question the experts come down on both sides of. Some think it is doomed to go the
way of the Corvair and the Bon Vivant line of canned soups, whose producers tried and failed to persuade the
public that there was no longer anything to fear. Headlines about instant death, said Stephen Greyser, who
teaches marketing theory at Harvard Business School, have a far more profound effect on most people than any
number of studies showing more probable but gradual health consequences, such as the incidence of lung
cancer among smokers.
With Extra-Strength Tylenol, said Greyser, "it's very easy for the consumer to say, 'Holy moly, this could happen
to me tomorrow!' "
But others see Tylenol's predicament as closer to that of the DC10 after the 1979 Chicago air crash in which an
engine mount broke and 278 people died. Although wide-body airplanes have been slow sellers generally over
the last few years, the public seems to have accepted the Federal Aviation Administration's finding that the
Chicago crash was basically the result of maintenance procedures rather than any defect in the plane itself.
The DC10/Tylenol analogy also includes the role of an intermediate player between the manufacturer and the
public -- the airlines in one case, and the medical profession in the other. After the Chicago crash, airline officials
were "staunch defenders of the airplane and staunch critics of the press," according to John Cooke of McDonnell
Douglas, whose Douglas Aircraft subsidiary makes the DC10.
Tylenol built its extraordinary $400-million-a-year sales volume and 37 percent share of the pain-reliever market
through an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at doctors. So the typical Tylenol user is "very dependent on
the opinion of the professional," to quote one marketing expert with long experience in the pharmaceutical field. If
doctors renew their endorsement, he speculates, their patients could well fall in line.
The fervent loyalty of some Tylenol users is documented by the experience of a high executive at the
Bristol-Myers Co., who tried and failed to persuade his mother to abandon Tylenol in favor of Bristol-Myers' Datril,
a competing version of the same aspirin substitute, acetaminophen. Just as the patient-doctor bond proved
stronger than the mother-son bond in this case, it has been credited with keeping Datril sales down around 3
percent of the pain-reliever market to date.
Endorsements have always been an option for the company out to win back public confidence in a tainted
product. After the Food and Drug Administration put the nation on alert about the presence of a carcinogenic
weed-killer in some of the 1957, 1958 and 1959 cranberry crops, it became de rigueur for potential presidential

candidates not only to belittle the danger but to consume cranberries at every opportunity. A few weeks before
Thanksgiving 1959, Richard M. Nixon had four helpings of cranberry sauce at a testimonial dinner for Rep. Melvin
Laird, held in the cranberry-growing community of Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. On the very same night John F.
Kennedy ate cranberries at a political function 31 miles away in Marshfield, Wis.
"I see no reason for hysteria over cranberries on any consumer's part," Nixon declared. "I am certain the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare is working rapidly to separate those comparatively few
contaminated cranberries, and I, like other Americans, expect to eat traditional cranberries with my family on
Thanksgiving Day." Kennedy echoed similar sentiments, minus the plug for the Eisenhower administration. (Only
Hubert Humphrey sounded an incongruous note, attacking certain nameless politicians for practicing "cranberry
politics" and vowing not to "turn phony for political advantage.")
After the DC10 disaster, the manufacturer considered hiring Bo Derek and Jane Fonda as spokeswomen, before
deciding on former astronaut Pete Conrad, who was already a company executive. Conrad became the star of an
intensive six-month series of advertisements in which he invited concerned passengers to send in for a free
booklet about the DC10 and its safety record. Some 470,000 of the booklets were mailed out, and "we reduced to
some considerable degree the existing passenger resistance to the DC10," said Cooke. "It got down to a level
comparable to that of other airplanes. Now would it have gone down anyway? I don't know."
The DC10 debate was a case in which the maker fought back hard against what it saw as unwarranted charges
and disproportionate press coverage. "I think the publicity that followed that accident was the world's most
extensive brainwashing in history," Douglas Aircraft President John C. Brizendene said at the time.
The tuna fish industry took an even more aggressive stance after the FDA ordered a national withdrawal and
emergency analysis of all canned tuna in December 1970, because mercury levels in some tuna lots exceeded
the then-standard maximum of 0.5 parts per million (later lowered to 0.1 ppm). Industry officials bitterly
complained that the FDA standard was "an arbitrary guideline . . . based on nothing other than a guess," in the
words of Hal Kierce, who handles public relations for the Tuna Research Foundation.
The tuna industry was also bitter about how the press handled the issue. "I got my feet wet in the tuna industry
just about this time," Kierce said, "and when the announcement was made on December 15, it got massive
coverage. But the February 15 announcement that everything on the shelf was hunky-dorey was somewhere on
page 32 and it was a two-paragraph story in the New York Daily News ." CBS-TV, Kierce adds, ran a news story
illustrating the controversy with graphic footage of Japanese victims of massive mercury poisoning. But later, in
response to industry criticism, CBS aired a correction in which it acknowledged that the mercury levels had been
many times higher in the Japanese case.
The demand for tuna fish dropped about 50 percent in the wake of the mercury uproar, according to Kierce, and
took a year to return to normal. He attributes the revival partly to an "intensified marketing effort" and partly to
tuna fish's long-term popularity. "My wife and my mother always had tuna on the shelf. Of course in my mother's
day Friday was fish day for the R.C.'s Roman Catholics and we always had tuna, and then the pope changed the
drill. But habits live on."
Tuna fish also had the advantage of being an inexpensive, long-lasting food. "If there is no alternative, time will
heal all wounds," said one marketing expert. "Where there is a ready alternative -- perhaps in the case of the
Corvair -- people can switch without any penalty."
A year was also how long it took cranberry sales to be revived, according to Christine Masclee, director of
communications for Ocean Spray, a cooperative owned by 700 cranberry growers and 100 citrus growers. But the
industry suffered a huge loss in 1959 because the alarm had been sounded just before Thanksgiving. Much of the
loss, however, was covered by a $10-million federal-government indemnification program, reflecting the cranberry
growers' argument that they had been the victims of "overreaction on the part of HEW."
The cranberry scare had an unexpected spinoff effect. Two polls of the cranberry's "public image" helped
persuade the industry that it was too dependent on the Thanksgiving and Christmas trade. The result was the rise
of cranberry juice and drinks for year-round consumption. "It prompted us to take a much closer pulse of
consumers," said Masclee, "and see where the market was and where we should grow."
In all these cases, producers have shied away from using advertisements to respond squarely to the charges.
"The decision was not to hit the issue directly but just to present tuna as a very nutritious, protein-rich, low-calorie
and low-cholesterol food," said Kierce. "We reinforced all the positives."

But in one bizarre case, the manufacturer felt it had no choice but to put the issue before its customers as
conspicuously as possible. The manufacturer was the Life Saver Co., and the problem was an unfounded rumor
that spiders' eggs had been found in Bubble Yum, a Life Saver product. The rumor hit just when Bubble Yum was
going through "almost a breakthrough in sales achievements," recalled Robert Denny, Life Saver's vice president
of product management. Within 10 days, company surveys showed that "well over half" of the children in the New
York area had heard the rumor, according to Denny, "and despite recommendations by some public relations
people to ignore the rumor and talk about the positive benefits of the product, we chose to run an ad in all the
newspapers. "Somebody is telling very bad lies about a very good product," the headline proclaimed.
As a result, the rumor faded, and years later Bubble Yum remains the best-selling brand of bubble gum in the
nation.
Retired public relations man Bob Cherneff worked on the problems of saccharin, another example of industry's
going on the offensive. "We mounted a campaign," he recalled, "to bring to the attention of the decision-makers -in this case, the congressmen -- the whole question of how reliable the data were, and the importance of this
substance to such large groups of people in our body politic -- the diabetics and the people who were
constitutionally, physiologically overweight, the diabetic teen-agers and the overweight teen-agers who wanted to
be able to do the teen-age things.
"One of the first things we did -- and of course this was a gimmick -- was to translate into human terms what the
rat dosage would mean. We came up with a photograph of a person in a room literally inundated with packages of
saccharin. Another thing we did was to make sure to the best of our ability that those scientists who doubted the
efficacy of the tests on which the FDA was basing its action -- and they weren't Humpty Dumptys either -- that
their voices were heard."
What all this history means for Tylenol and Johnson & Johnson is debatable. But whatever course the company
follows, and whatever the ultimate result, J&J has already won high marks for corporate valor under fire and for
applying these principles:
* Be Straightforward. "When you've got a disaster," said Jon Jessar of the Washington public relations firm Bob
Gray and Co., "you've got to be out front and be honest. The people at Johnson & Johnson have done a good job
up to this point. Their spokesmen have been very human. They have not attempted to get out and protect the
product." By contrast, the proprietors of Bon Vivant Soups and of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant are widely
faulted for coming across as defensive in their moments of crisis.
* Act Fast. "Within an hour after [Johnson & Johnson] heard about the first alert from the health examiner," said
communications consultant Ed Gottlieb of Chester Burger and Co., "they undertook to notify the entire Chicago
press. That is the kind of action that these situations call for."
* Put the Problem in the Best Focus. "It's clearly in Johnson & Johnson's interest to have consumers feel that it's
more of an industrywide problem, even though at the moment it's just Johnson & Johnson's problem," said
Harvard's Stephen Greyser. "Tylenol happens to be a brand that for one reason or another was selected by an
apparently aberrational individual. It didn't have to be Tylenol, necessarily, unless it turns out to be a disgruntled
employe. So it's really a secure-packaging issue that goes beyond any one brand. And from a strategy point of
view, I think one of the things the company should be doing is to press for an industrywide program of more
secure, tamper-proof packaging."
No one is predicting that Tylenol will return to national favor anytime soon, or without a hard struggle. "Whether
they can continue to market a product called Tylenol or whether they have to dump it and start with another
product is questionable," said Cherneff. But two factors could be in Johnson & Johnson's favor. One is sheer size.
"If this were a single-line company," said Greyser, "there wouldn't be enough time to have the recovery happen."
With $5.4 billion in over-all sales last year, however, Johnson & Johnson can afford to take the long view -- unlike,
for example, Bon Vivant Soups Inc., which went bankrupt only a month after its vichyssoise was implicated in the
death of a New York man and the FDA ordered the recall of more than a million cans of soup.
The other favorable factor is the sheer number of product-disasters American consumers have experienced.
"People are a little more sophisticated about products," said Kierce. "There isn't this sheeplike aversion. They've
been through a lot of scares."

COUPLE SOUGHT IN EXTORTION NOW TIED TO TYLENOL DEATHS

CHICAGO, Oct. 18 -- A fugitive Missouri couple already wanted for extortion were identified today as the ''primary
leads'' in the investigation into the deaths of seven persons from cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules.
It was the first time the couple, James W. Lewis and his wife, Leann, had been linked to the poison deaths by the
joint Federal, state and local police task force that is investigating the bizarre case that began Sept. 29.
Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner, the director of the task force, said the Lewises, who have used many
aliases in recent years, were being sought in connection with an attempt to extort $1 million from the Johnson &
Johnson Company, the parent company of the maker of Tylenol, under threat of further poisoning incidents.
But today Mr. Fahner linked the Lewises and the poison deaths. ''Let me define them as our primary leads in the
case,'' he told reporters.
Officials Study Photograph
Tonight, WBBM, a local television station, released a photo it said was obtained from a television monitor at a
Walgreen's drug store where one of the victims bought the contaminated capsules. The photo appeared to show
Paula Prince, who later died after swallowing a poisoned Tylenol capsule, paying the cashier while a man in a
light jacket watched nearby. However, the photograph was grainy and the man's features indistinct.
Reacting to the photo, Mr. Fahner said only that the man ''could be'' Mr. Lewis, who was born Theodore Elmer
Wilson, took the name Lewis after he was put up for adoption and also used the alias Robert Richardson in
Chicago. ''There are a lot of photos of people who look like Richardson,'' Mr. Fahner said, indicating a stack of
photographs about six inches thick.
The Attorney General said if the image turned out to be that of Mr. Lewis, ''it could be tangible evidence, could
complete the circle as much as a fingerprint.'' He said technicians were using enhancement techniques to try to
improve the image, but he warned against premature conclusions. ''We have an awful lot of photographs,'' he
said, ''We didn't think it prudent to release them. A lot of people could unnecessarily be harmed or embarrassed.''
'Pattern of Fraud and Extortion
Warrants have been issued for the arrest of the Lewises, who are suspected by the authorities of having been
involved in several extortion and fraud schemes. ''A pattern of fraud and extortion is not new for Mr. Lewis,'' Mr.
Fahner said. ''They could be responsible for the Tylenol murders.''
The two were last reported seen in Chicago in September, but Mr. Fahner said they were in the United States
over the weekend. He would not say where. But he did say that Mr. Lewis's fingerprints were found on the
extortion letter and that technicians were trying to match those prints with partial prints found on the contaminated
bottles and capsules of Tylenol.
Mr. Fahner said that ''We have no direct evidence'' linking the Lewises to the poisonings. A moment later, he
added, ''We could answer that very quickly with the Lewises in custody.'' He did not elaborate.
''We don't know the answer to whether or not they committed the Tylenol murders,'' he said. ''We do know they
are capable of it.'' He said earlier schemes in which the Lewises were suspected were ''motivated by money.''
Charged in 1978 Slaying
Page 132 of 140 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

In 1978 Mr. Lewis was charged with murder in the slaying of Raymond West, a 72-year-old Kansas City man who
had hired Mr. Lewis as an accountant. Mr. West's dismembered and decomposed body was found hanging from
a pulley in his attic the same day Mr. Lewis tried to cash a forged check on his account. The case was dismissed
when the judge found that the police did not inform Mr. Lewis of his rights at the time of his arrest.
Kansas City police reopened their investigation into the 1978 slaying after a detective saw a photograph of Mr.
Lewis in the Tylenol investigation.
Until now, the authorities had been working under the theory that the poisonings, in which Tylenol was believed
replaced with potassium cyanide granules and the bottles returned to store shelves, were the work of a
''madman'' committing random murder. The officials have a shifting list of ''potential suspects,'' all in Illinois, they
said.
''We have not excluded any other people we are looking at,'' Mr. Fahner said today. However, later in the news
conference he ruled out Roger Arnold, a Chicago shipping dock worker whose interest in poisons, employment at
a Tylenol warehouse and acquaintaince with the father of one victim raised suspicions last week.
Mr. Fahner said an ''extraordinary number'' of tips on new suspects and the whereabouts of the Lewises
continued to come in on the task force's information telephone number (312-827-9770). ''We think we have a
good chance of finding him,'' Mr. Fahner said.
Mr. Fahner, citing the recent incidents of ''copycat'' poisonings across the nation, also said he was contacting all
local Parent-Teacher Associations to suggest that all children's Halloween parties this year be held in schools and
churches, rather than allowing the children to beg for candy door-to-door.

The nation's over-the-counter drug makers asked the federal government yesterday to require tamper-resistent
packages for their products in the wake of last month's poisoning of Tylenol capsules in Chicago, but they said
the method of doing it should be left to individual manufacturers.
At the same time, two major drug outlets in the Washington area -- Giant Food Inc. and People's Drug Stores -said new shipments of their own house brands of over-the-counter capsules will be in sealed packages so that
customers can easily see if they have been tampered with. Dr. David Richman of Giant said the new packages
should be on the chain's shelves within two weeks.
Johnson & Johnson, whose McNeil Consumer Products subsidiary manufactures Tylenol, said it is evaluating
several ways of making its packages tamper-resistent but declined to reveal what method it is likely to pick.
Tylenol, the nation's best-selling over-the-counter pain killing drug with an estimated 37 percent of the
billion-dollar-a-year market, was pulled off the market after seven deaths were blamed on capsules tainted with
cyanide. Even though McNeil has been absolved of blame in the deaths, the New Jersey firm said it would not
sell any more Tylenol in capsules until all of the capsules can be packaged in tamper-resistent containers.
The move by the Proprietary Association, a trade group of over-the-counter drug makers, appeared aimed at
restoring public confidence in the entire $6 billion-a-year industry. Sales of all nonprescription drugs reportedly
have slumped nationwide as consumers reacted with apprehension to reports of the Tylenol-connected deaths.

CHICAGO, Oct. 14 -- A man accused of trying to extort $1 million from the company that makes Extra-Strength
Tylenol capsules was charged, but not tried, with the death of a Kansas City man in 1978, the authorities said
today.
Three Kansas City police officers flew to Chicago today with documents and evidence pertaining to a man known
as Robert Richardson, who is charged with sending an extortion letter to Johnson & Johnson after seven
Chicago-area residents died after swallowing cyanide-spiked Tylenol capsules.
Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner, who is directing the investigation into the Tylenol-related deaths, said
that Mr. Richardson and his wife, Nancy, who also use the names James and Leann Lewis, were charged with
murder and extortion there in 1978 after the dismembered and ''semi-mummified'' body of Raymond West was
found in Mr. West's attic. The charges were dropped when the cause of Mr. West's death could not be
determined.
''Obviously this has great significance,'' Mr. Fahner said. But he added that there was no known link between the
Richardsons and any of the cyanide victims or Johnson & Johnson.

Barely a week after three members of the Janus family died in a Chicago suburb after taking Extra-Strength
Tylenol capsules that contained cyanide, their survivors were in Cook County Circuit Court, suing the drug's
manufacturer and a distributor. The families of the four other Tylenol victims seem likely to follow.
Much remains to be determined before the nature of the three separate Janus family lawsuits will fully emerge.
The suits seek $15 million for the wrongful death, pain and suffering, and funeral expenses of one victim and $10
million each for the other two. However, at least two points about the suits already seem clear.
First, even if the cyanide was put into the capsules by a deranged person, the manufacturer, the McNeill
Consumer Products Company, a division of Johnson & Johnson, and the various retailers, Jewel Food Stores in
the case of the Januses, could still be held legally liable for the deaths, either separately or together.
Second, for reasons rooted in American product liability law and loyalty by jurors toward some corporations and
the jurors' sense of fairness, such an outcome is extremely unlikely unless new and incriminating evidence
emerges.
As a general proposition, a manufacturers's liability for defective products has increased dramatically since the
19th century, when even negligent producers were legally blameless unless consumers had dealt with them
directly. Middlemen Brought a Change
It was only as wholesalers and distributers, the so-called middlemen, entered the stream of commerce that this
requirement eroded and was finally buried in the landmark case of MacP@herson v. Buick Motor Company in
1916. Writing for the New York Court of Appeals, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo held that if a dangerous product
was made without a reasonable regard for safety, the consumer could sue the manufacturer directly.
Nearly half a century later, the California Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roger Traynor, dropped the
reasonableness requirement for a ''strict liability'' standard, whereby injured parties need only prove a product
was defective to collect damages. That standard was adopted in Illinois and most other states because it seemed
fairer to victims and was thought to encourage manufacturers to produce safer products.
To some degree, the strict liability standard suggests that McNeil could be held responsible for the Tylenol
deaths, regardless of how the cyanide got into the capsules. But strict liability does not mean a manufacturer is
liable in all instances. The Tylenol plaintiffs must establish either that the individual product they had purchased
deviated from normal manufacturing standards or was defective in its design.
''It's clear that those who drafted the strict liability rules did not have sabotage in mind,'' said Gary T. Schwartz, a
law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. Inquiry on Production Expected
The Januses' case is strongest if they can prove that the medicine was contaminated when it left the factory,
because manufacturing defects usually fall clearly under strict liability rules. Leonard M. Ring, the Chicago
attorney representing all of those who have so far filed suit, can thus be expected to conduct a vigorous
investigation of the production and quality control procedures of the McNeil plant in Fort Washington, Pa.
If the police prove that someone outside the plant was responsible, Mr. Ring could concentrate on Jewel, which
the authorities believe unknowingly sold the capsules after they had been contaminated. As for McNeil, instead of

attempting to prove that only a few Tylanol capsules, those with the cyanide, were defective, Mr. Ring may seek
to show that all Tylenol capsules were defective because of improper design and packaging.
In his court papers Mr. Ring maintained that Tylenol bottles lacked tamper-proof caps and lids and were not
adequately sealed; that they contained no plastic or foil coverings over the bottle tops or warnings to users to
inspect the contents for tampering, and, most important, that Tylenol capsules could be easily taken apart and
reassembled. He plans to argue that these are defects that made the danger of poisoning both forseeable and
avoidable.
But this argument also has problems, most notably in what Terrence Kiely, a law professor at DePaul University
in Chicago, calls ''the old 'everybody was doing it' defense.'' In Illinois as most other states, manufacturers can
largely rebut assertions about design defects by showing they were following ''state of the art'' procedures. This
has often been construed by the courts to mean common usage rather than the most advanced technology
available. Defense Not Foolproof
The defense is not foolproof, however, if those suing the company can prove both that the drug industry was
aware of the dangers from possible tampering and that cheap and feasible alternative methods of packaging that
would minimize the risk were readily available.
There seems little doubt that the lawyer could satisfy the second requirement because sealed capsules that are
essentially tamper-proof have been around for years. But the fact that some drug manufacturers use such
capsules does not indicate there was an industry-wide recognition of the threat of tampering before the Tylenol
deaths.
''What we are now calling 'security packaging' has been around for a long time,'' said Dr. Mark Novitch, deputy
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. ''But it's been used mainly to preserve sterility, freshness or
appearance. Although there have been some other episodes of tampering before, none of them has been on this
scale and certainly there have been no deaths as a result.''
For this reason, and the strong possibilty that an individual not connected with the manufacturing or distributing
process is responsible for the poisoning, scholars and lawyers predict rough going in the courts for the Janus
family and others who may seek damages in the Tylenol case. Case Could Be Dismissed
''With the intentional intervention of a third party and the lack of forseeability, it would be hard to get past a motion
to dismiss the case,'' said Robert Rabin, a professor at Stanford Law School.
Legal experts assert, moreover, that even if the case got beyond the judge, a jury's customary antipathy to large
corporations and sympathy for those suing them may not be a factor this time. Instead, they say, the jury's sense
of fair play and corporate loyalty, particularly to Johnson & Johnson, a manufacturer of baby powder, could
present difficult obstacles to the plaintiffs.
''To hold the manufacturer liable for the work of a lunatic would seem to go against their reasoning, even though
the theory might be legally tenable,'' said Melvin Block, a prominent products liability lawyer in Brooklyn.
Still, the experts concede that things could quickly change if any proof is discovered that the company knew or
should have known its product was dangerous. This is what happened a few years ago when the Ford Motor
Company was found liable in the case of several people who were killed or injured in fiery automobile accidents
involving the Pinto.
''It's an uphill case until you discover more things,'' said Paul D. Rheingold, a New York trial lawyer who
specializes in cases involving pharmaceutical drugs. ''So many times you get into a case and find a smoking gun.
One sheet of paper shifts the whole balance of the litigation.''
In fact, all that seems clear now is that whatever their outcome, the Tylenol cases are certain to have substantial
consequences in the areas of law and packaging. Manufacturers have been put on notice that the risk of
tampering is real, so real that they could well be held liable for it the next time it happens.

F.B.I. SEEKS MAN OF TYLENOL EXTORTION CHARGE

F.B.I. SEEKS MAN OF TYLENOL EXTORTION CHARGE

CHICAGO, Oct. 13 -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained a warrant here today for the arrest of Robert
Richardson, a Chicago man accused of trying to extort $1 million from the makers of Extra-Strength Tylenol by
threatening to put poison in more of the popular pain reliever's capsules.
The Chicago police and authorities on the task force investigating seven deaths in this area from cyanide-laced
Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules cautioned that Mr. Richardson, who is about 35 years old, had not been totally
ruled out as a suspect in the original poison deaths. But they said he was wanted now only for trying to extort
money from Tylenol's corporate parent, Johnson & Johnson. He was believed to be somewhere in Oklahoma or
Texas, the authorities said.
At an afternoon news conference at the task force's suburban headquarters in Des Plaines, Tyrone Fahner,
Illinois Attorney General, characterized the letter as a ''hoax.'' He released a copy of it and discussed the overall
Tylenol case.
Mr. Fahner, who heads the task force, said agents from Federal, state and local law-enforcement departments
were making ''substantial progress'' in their search for the person or persons they believe replaced Tylenol with
deadly cyanide, but he provided few details of the progress.He said that no arrests were imminent.
Mr. Fahner also continued to maintain that all of the incidents of allegedly tainted medicines reported elsewhere,
including one of Visine eyedrops contaminated in Colorado, were unrelated to the Chicago Tylenol case.
''All the evidence we have at this point in time suggests that the two matters - the Visine episode in Grand
Junction, Colo., and the cyanide killings here in the Chicago area - are totally unrelated'' he said. ''It does not
suggest a threat to anyone here in Illinois and we are informed by Colorado authorities it doesn't even suggest a
threat to the people in Grand Junction.''
The Attorney General also appeared to rule out the relevance to the Tylenol case of the arrest here Tuesday
night of Roger Arnold, identified as a 48-year-old worker on the loading docks of a warehouse where Tylenol may
have been handled on the way to area stores.
Acting on a telephone tip that Mr. Arnold was ''known to have cyanide in his house'' on Chicago's South side, city
police also found unregistered firearms, an unidentified white powder and literature on poisons. But they said they
did not believe he was a ''hard lead'' in the poison case. He was charged with possessing the unregistered
firearms and with aggravated assault arising from an incident some months ago.
''The Arnold case is not more promising than anything we've seen so far,'' said Mr. Fahner, ''In fact, it is
symptomatic of the amount of energy that goes into following cases which appear to have a great deal of
promise. We have several of equal worth.''
Mr. Fahner said agents ruled out no possibility completely, but added that they still believe the capsules were
contaminated in Illinois near the retail store shortly before their sale. He declined to elaborate.
''I think,'' he went on, ''you will see a lot of other false leads between now and the solution of this particular crime.''
The handprinted extortion letter released today warns of new poisoned capsules unless $1 million is sent to an
account at the Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago.

The authorities traced the closed bank account to the former operator of a local travel service. Mr. Fahner said
that the man, whose identity was withheld to avoid embarrassment, ''has never been a suspect in this case, but
rather is another victim.'' The agency operator, he said, was the victim of a hoax.
Mr. Richardson's wife, Nancy, who is being sought for questioning, was a former employee of the travel agency
with knowledge of the owner's bank accounts. ''She left under unpleasant circumstances,'' Mr. Fahner said of the
job. After comparing samples of Mr. Richardson's writing and the extortion note, the F.B.I. sought the arrest
warrant.
